@2 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Find Elminster

I met a mage at the Crooked Crane Inn who claims to be an acquaintance of Elminster and who asked me to deliver a message to the old mage himself. I have promised nothing but have agreed to carry it in case I come across Elminster somewhere in the course of our travels.~
@3 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Find Elminster

I found Elminster in Trademeet and he was not happy with Lief's news. He has asked me to look into a 'minor' problem for him - the 'problem' with Elminster's 'minor problems' is that they are never simple - or minor. I am to travel to the town of Porthpentyrch and investigate why the villagers are missing.~
@4 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Find Elminster

I finally agreed with Elminster to look into a 'minor' problem for him - the 'problem' with Elminster's 'minor problems' is that they are never simple - or minor. I am to travel to the town of Porthpentyrch and investigate why the villagers are missing.~
@5 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

The lighthouse keeper told us of a Red Wizard of Thay and of the strange goings-on in his lighthouse. We promised to investigate, but with his report of the gating in of a demon, I am not happy with the thought of facing it. It sounds like something went wrong with the Wizard's summoning and it is still trapped there at the top.~
@6 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

The lighthouse keeper spun us a suspect tale of a Red Wizard of Thay and of the strange goings-on in his lighthouse. Demon? Ha! It's probably no more than pure imagination and fear.~

@7 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

We found a tanar'ri trapped on the top floor of the lighthouse at Porthpentyrch. It seems that a Red Wizard, Olren of Thay, made a mess of the incantation and now the tanar'ri needs our help to get back to his own plane. He's a bad-tempered bastard - he fireballed me and I want revenge for that. He made some mention of the 'Traps of the Living' - I don't much like the sound of that.~
@8 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

We found a tanar'ri trapped on the top floor of the lighthouse at Porthpentyrch. It seems that a Red Wizard, Olren of Thay, made a mess of the incantation and now the tanar'ri needs our help to get back to his own plane. He's a bad-tempered bastard and I don't think I want to cross him in a hurry. He made some mention of the 'Traps of the Living' - I don't much like the sound of that.~
@9 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

We found a tanar'ri trapped on the top floor of the lighthouse at Porthpentyrch. It seems that a Red Wizard, Olren of Thay, made a mess of the incantation and now the tanar'ri needs our help to get back to his own plane. He has promised me help if we succeed. He made some mention of the 'Traps of the Living' - I don't much like the sound of that.~
@10 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

We found a tanar'ri trapped on the top floor of the lighthouse at Porthpentyrch. It seems that a Red Wizard, Olren of Thay, made a mess of the incantation and now the tanar'ri needs our help to get back to his own plane. He has promised me a reward for helping him. He made some mention of the 'Traps of the Living' - I don't much like the sound of that.~
@11 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

The tanar'ri laughed at us for failing to pass the Traps of the Living, then told us to talk to someone called Ceinwen Ravenhair who, it appears, lives somewhere in the Government District of Athkatla.~
@12 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

The Cowled Wizards have seized Ceinwen Ravenhair. If I hurry, I may catch them before they send her to Spellhold.~
@13 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Trimthorns

Young Gaelie Trimthorn in the slums of Athkatla has asked me to look for her father, Kalun Trimthorn. He was last known to be heading for the Forest of Tethyr to look for some special wood for his trade of carver and woodcutter.~
@14 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Trimthorns

I reunited Gaelie and her father, Kalun. She has promised not to let him go wandering again.~
@15 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

The Cowled Wizards have seized Ceinwen Ravenhair. A peasant in the slums says that if I hurry, I may catch them before they send her to Spellhold.~
@16 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

The tanar'ri was not pleased to find out Ceinwen Ravenhair had been banished to Spellhold. Apparently our only chance of freeing him now and solving the mystery of Porthpentyrch is to find Elminster again.~
@17 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

We found a tanar'ri trapped on the top floor of the lighthouse at Porthpentyrch. It seems that a Red Wizard, Olren of Thay, made a mess of the incantation to call him and now the tanar'ri needs our help to get back to his own plane. He laughed at us for failing to pass the Traps of the Living, then told us to talk to someone called Ceinwen Ravenhair who, it appears, lives somewhere in the Slums District of Athkatla.~
@18 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

We freed Ceinwen Ravenhair from the grip of the Cowled Wizards by buying a magic-user's license for her.~
@19 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

We freed Ceinwen Ravenhair from the grip of the Cowled Wizards by paying their dirty blackmail money. 4,000 gold! This hedge-witch had better be worth it.~
@20 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

I freed the hedge-witch Ceinwen Ravenhair from Spellhold and she is not the slightest bit grateful. Ha! As long as she gets me past the Traps of the Living, I don't care.~
@21 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

I freed Ceinwen Ravenhair from Spellhold and promised to meet her back in Athkatla when this mess with Irenicus is over.~
@22 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Trimthorns

I met a woodsman in the Forest of Tethyr who said that Kalun Trimthorn had moved on to the North Forest. The woodsman also warned me about vampires and imps up there. Oh yes, and he tells lousy jokes.~
@23 = ~Fishing for Trouble

I freed Ceinwen Ravenhair from Spellhold and promised to meet her back in Athkatla when this mess with Irenicus is done.~
@24 =~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

Ceinwen Ravenhair has agreed to help us pass the Traps of the Living. We need to get the blood of a child vampire. Ceinwen thinks there is one below the graveyard in Athkatla and we have agreed to put it to rest.~
@25 =~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

Ceinwen has told us to return in two days for the spells to pass the Traps of the Living.~
@26 =~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

Ceinwen Ravenhair has given us the pieces of the puzzle to pass the Traps of the Living. I must swallow two potions and after they have taken effect, I have just two hours to accomplish whatever it is I need to do before I must take the antidote.~
@27 =~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

The hedge-witch has given us the pieces of the puzzle to pass the Traps of the Living. Now to get rid of that damned tanar'ri and find out what's going on in that miserable village.~
@28=~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

The Cowled Wizards have imprisoned Ceinwen Ravenhair in Spellhold. The tanar'ri is not going to be very pleased with that news.~
@29=~Fishing for Trouble

Elminster has gone to Brynnlaw himself to free Ceinwen Ravenhair from Spellhold. This lady must be more important than I thought!~
@30=~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

Elminster has brought Ceinwen Ravenhair back to the Slums District.~
@31 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Trimthorns

I met a woodsman in the Forest of Tethyr who said that Kalun Trimthorn had moved on to the North Forest. The woodsman also warned me about vampires and imps up there.~
@32 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Demon in the Lighthouse

According to the tanar'ri, Olren of Thay thought to summon four demons to protect four wagonloads of Black Lotus bound for the underside of the Sword Coast. The tanar'ri also mentioned the Twin Towers north of Crimmor. It seems some Red Wizards have actually joined together in the hope of causing untold misery in exchange for gold. They were last known to be heading for Cerendor Hold, north of Trademeet. I should travel there to investigate.~
@33=~Fishing for Trouble: The Black Lotus Caravan

The Red Wizards have been shipping black lotus through Cerendor Hold for quite some time and have now taken over the hold as a staging point. The Caravan Master has asked for our help to free the hold and I agreed. There are other Hold Guards imprisoned in the basement and will help us if we can free them. We are to give him the signal when we are ready to attack.~
@34=~Fishing for Trouble: The Black Lotus Caravan

The Red Wizards have been shipping black lotus through here for quite some time and have now taken over the hold as a staging point. The Caravan Master has asked for our help but I refused.~
@35=~Fishing for Trouble: Cerendor Hold

I have changed my mind about not helping the Caravan Master of Cerendor Hold. There are other Hold Guards imprisoned in the basement and will help us if we can free them. We are to give him the signal when we are ready to attack.~
@36=~Fishing for Trouble: Cerendor Hold

We successfully cleared out Cerendor Hold and have hopefully dealt a heavy blow to Homen Odesseiron's ambitions on the Sword Coast. We also captured a Red Wizard who gave us some very interesting information; he confirmed that the caravan is only one day ahead and moving very slowly. We may yet catch it in the Cloudpeak Mountains if we hurry.~
@37=~Fishing for Trouble: The Black Lotus Caravan

Finally we have some hard facts about the black lotus trade that has sprung up along the Sword Coast. The Red Wizard Ailoth Tam confirmed that Homen Odesseiron was behind the trade and that the main shipment point was Athkatla. The shipment is being handled by Maredudd Bengoch in the docks district of Athkatla. Ailoth Tam also revealed that the tanar'ri could be returned to his plane by one Garalial Geltarath, an ex-Harper, located in the west end of the Government district of Athkatla.~
@38=~Fishing for Trouble: The Orb of Breaca

Angharad Firehair, consort of Garalial Geltarath the renegade harper, has hired me to retrieve the orb from the sceptre of the dwarf-king buried in the halls below Porthpentyrch. This is the price I have to pay for Garalial Geltarath's help to restore the village.~
@39=~Fishing for Trouble: The Orb of Breaca

I have given the Orb of Breaca to that whining half-elf Angharad Firehair. I also made it very clear that if her ex-Harper lover did not deliver the goods and free Porthpentyrch from that idiot Olren of Thay's spell, I would come looking for both of them and they would both die very slowly.~
@40=~Fishing for Trouble: The Orb of Breaca

I have given the Orb of Breaca to Angharad Firehair. Now to see if Garalial Geltarath will honour his side of the bargain.~
@41 =~Fishing for Trouble

We have put to rest the spirit of Meilir of Meilirion. In return he gave us the Orb of Breaca which we must now return to Angharad Firehair.~
@42 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Orb of Breaca

So much for the spirit of Meilir of Meilirion. At least he was not lying about the Orb; I now have it in my possession.~
@43 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Ceinwen Ravenhair

I killed the child vampire as requested by Ceinwen Ravenhair but I did not use the Vampire Bloodsucker knife she gave me. She says that she can no longer help me pass the Traps of the Living and so I cannot get the key that the tanar'ri requires to return to his own plane. This means that my mission from Elminster is at an end; he is not going to be the slightest bit pleased with me.~
@44 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Finally! I have gotten the renegade Harper to go to Porthpentyrch and lift the curse. He says not to follow him for one week - I wonder what will happen if I do?~
@45 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Well, I got my answer. The renegade now says that I have destroyed all possible chance of the curse on Porthpentyrch being lifted. Just wait till Elminster hears about his stupid behaviour!~
@46 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

I arrived in Porthpentyrch some time before Garalial Geltarath had finished lifting the curse. For this I must suffer the knowledge that the village is cursed forever and the tanar'ri is trapped in the lighthouse for all time. Elminster will not be happy with me.~
@47 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

The renegade has successfully lifted the curse on Porthpentyrch. Now to find Elminster and take the credit for it. He said he would be staying in the Inn of the Seven Vales in Athkatla.~
@48 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Garalial Geltarath, Angharad Firehair and Eildaren Colver have successfully lifted the curse on Porthpentyrch; there also seems to be a reconciliation of sorts between Garalial and Jaheira. I have some good news to tell Elminster!~
@49 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Garalial Geltarath, Angharad Firehair and Eildaren Colver have successfully lifted the curse on Porthpentyrch and returned the tanar'ri to his own plane. I have some good news to tell Elminster!~
@50 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Elminster didn't believe me when I told him of the errors that the ex-Harper Geltarath had made. Well, good riddance to both of them - they've given me the run-round for long enough. Why should I care if some tanar'ri is trapped in a lighthouse in the forgotten backside of nowhere? Let the village rot and fall down! I am done with it.~
@51 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

I had to confess to Elminster that I had wrecked the chances of restoring Porthpentyrch right at the last. For this I must suffer the knowledge that the village is cursed forever and the tanar'ri is trapped in the lighthouse for all time. To say that Elminster was not happy with me is a gross understatement.~
@52 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Despite all the time and effort I put into solving this 'minor problem' of Elminster's, he was extremely ungrateful. Pah! I couldn't care less if I never saw him or his cohort Torman again.~
@53 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Elminster received the news of the saving of Porthpentyrch with a great deal of relief. He is now on his way to Calimshan to deal with Pasha Baadilhaela. I would not like to be him when the Sage of Shadowdale gets there; I doubt Elminster will be very sage at that meeting!~
@54 =~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Elminster received the news of the saving of Porthpentyrch with a great deal of relief. He was very surprised to learn of the involvement of Garalial Geltarath and even more surprised when Jaheira asked him to visit the ex-Harper. With luck and the will to do it, Garalial may yet be received back into that secretive band. Meanwhile, Elminster is now on his way to Calimshan to deal with Pasha Baadilhaela. I would not like to be him when the Sage of Shadowdale gets there; I doubt Elminster will be very sage at that meeting!~
@55 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Black Lotus Caravan

I found Maredudd Bengoch in Athkatla's harbour, negotiating for a ship to carry his 'wares' north to Waterdeep and Luskan. I told him about the destruction of his smuggling caravan and the release of Cerendor Hold, and although I expected a fight to the very death, I was able to persuade him to turn himself in to the local magistrate. I left him with the warning that if he did not do so, I would seek him out and would not be so lenient the next time. There is no doubt that with the destruction of the smuggler's route from Calimshan to Icewind Dale the supply of Black Lotus will run very dry - for a short while.~
@56 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Trimthorns

I had to give Gaelie the bad news that her father had died. The poor child looked as if the world had fallen to pieces around her.~
@57 = ~Fishing for Trouble: The Trimthorns

Stupid child started cursing me when I told that her father had died. No thanks at all for having spent all that time looking for him.~
@58 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Restore Porthpentyrch

Ailoth Tam says that an ex-Harper - Garalial Geltarath by name - has the power to undo the curse that holds Porthpentyrch. We can find him in the Government District Westside.~
@59 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Elizabeth Pavaral's Flamedance Ring

I have promised to find the thieves who stole Lady Pavaral's flamedance ring. She claimed the thieves vanished into a sewer grate but my guess is that they were headed for the Thieves Guild.~
@60 = ~Fishing for Trouble: Elizabeth Pavaral's Flamedance Ring

I have recovered Lady Pavaral's flamedance ring.~
@61 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Black Lotus Caravan

I found Maredudd Bengoch in Athkatla's harbour, negotiating for a ship to carry his 'wares' north to Waterdeep and Luskan. I told him about the destruction of his smuggling caravan and the release of Cerendor Hold and as you might guess, he was not too pleased. He attacked without warning and I was forced to kill him and his men. There is no doubt that with the destruction of the smuggler's route from Calimshan to Icewind Dale the supply of Black Lotus will run very dry - for a short while.~
@62 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Food Thief

My guess is that a gnome was responsible for the theft of food from the Cerendor kitchen but he was too quick for me and has escaped.~
@63 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Food Thief

Young Cado the gnome is our food thief. After being threatened with death by the Red Guards he holed up in the north drum tower of Cerendor Hold and survived by pretending to be a ghost!~
@64 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Food Thief

It seems that someone is stealing food from the Hold's kitchen. Countess Wulthof says that it isn't a huge amount but the cook is making a fuss over it. The countess would like me to try and track down the thief and have a word with him or her.~
@65 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Food Thief

I told the Countess that I suspected that her food thief was a small gnome who had been hiding out in the north drum tower. Unfortunately he had escaped before I could question him.~
@66 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Food Thief

I told the Countess that her food thief was a gnome who had been hiding out in the north drum tower. She laughed when she heard Cado's story and said that no further action would be taken.~
@67 =~Fishing for Trouble: The Food Thief

Well, the cook wasn't too helpful. She would have you believe that the storerooms are being emptied each night. The only useful snippet of information was that the thief disappeared through the upper door to the battlements. I'd better carry on searching the Hold for clues.~

I had an interesting conversation with a Red Wizard captured after the fight in Cerendor Hold. It seems that the drug trade along the Sword Coast is being controlled by Homen Odesseiron in Thay and Pasha Baadilhaela in Calimport. Both are in dire need of money - Elminster is going to be very interested in this. Ailoth Tam says that if I hurry I can catch up with the latest shipment somewhere in the Cloudpeak Mountains. I also need to see if he is telling the truth about Maredudd Bengoch heading to Athkatla's docks to hire a ship. And - finally! - I have a lead on how to remove the curse on Porthpentyrch. Ailoth Tam says that an ex-Harper by the name of Garalial Geltarath in Athkatla's Government District Westside may know how to lift the curse.~

I doubt Levon will be bothering Akil again any time soon. The young man is restored to his fortune, if not to his girl.~
@158 =~Fishing for Trouble: Kill Akil

@608  = ~Wha? Eh? Ah...~
@609  = ~Spit it out man! It won't bite you!~
@610  = ~Aahh! It can't be - no - it can't be true! You - you're real!~
@611  = ~Of course we're real! Why should we not be? What has happened?~
@612  = ~Ahhh! NO! Don't kill me! PLEASE!!!~
@613  = ~Speak quickly then or I *will* send you to join the dead.~
@614  = ~Undead - ghouls and - and - mummies. I saw them; prowling and killing and stealing souls. At first it was just at night; then they got bolder and came in the day.~
@615  = ~Then one night a huge demon came and sat in my lighthouse. Just appeared he did!!! In a burst of stinking gas worse than the smell of a week-dead corpse from the sea. And I got out - I only just got out.....~
@616  = ~Lucky you escaped and made it to here!~
@617  = ~And you ran to here?~
@618  = ~Ha! Ran like a yellow-livered mummy's boy, no doubt!~
@619  = ~YOU - DON'T - KNOW - WHAT - IT - WAS - LIKE!!!!!!! Kill me if it gives you pleasure - then go and bully someone else for kicks - *but don't call me a coward until you've been there!!!!*~
@620  = ~Soooo.... you do have fire in you after all..... And then what?~
@621  = ~Where else could I go? People were packing and leaving just as fast as they could. I thought I was safe - there - locked in my lighthouse, protected by stone walls but no, some damn great demon has to gate in and squat. *My* lighthouse!~
@622  = ~A demon you say... but how? Why?~
@623  = ~It was that mage, I'm sure of it. Red robes - came down the coast about half a year ago. He took up residence in the lighthouse with me, all sweet talk and friendliness. At first I took to him; he made the time pass more easily on stormy days and he used his magic to make the lighthouse a nicer place. Grew plants, that sort of thing - he even made two floors into a garden!~
@624  = ~Then gradually things began to be not *quite* right and the undead started to appear. In ones and twos at first - you have to understand that this is nothing new in a fishing town where ghosts come home from the sea all the time - but then people started to disappear.~
@625  = ~Disappear?~
@626  = ~Disappear - and reappear - and people began recognising friends and relatives in the undead that prowled the streets. The mage - he said his name was Olren of Thay - grew quiet and moody and went out at night but he always came back safely.~
@627  = ~At first I thought it was because he was a mage and protected himself, but things began happening in and around my lighthouse that I couldn't explain. One day I went to challenge him about it but I discovered I was too scared to speak; the next thing I really remember I was back in the light room and I don't know how I got there. After that, whenever he was around I hid - I couldn't help myself!~
@628  = ~Why? Did he cast a spell on you?~
@629  = ~Ha! A rat in a hole!~
@630  = ~I TOLD you - DON'T MOCK ME!!!! If you're so brave then you stay here at night, on your own and unarmed. You won't - I know you won't - I know your type; cowards behind the bluster and yellow without a sword.~
@631  = ~Hmm. Go on - your improbable tale interests me. You have a chance to keep your miserable life yet.~
@632  = ~I don't know why I hid. I just couldn't stand the sight of him - and I was desperately afraid. He took over the lamp room and the lamp went out. I couldn't get there to light it at night; so many ships nearly ripped to pieces on our coast.~
@633  = ~One did get caught... a storm whipped it round like a child's toy and splintered it against the rocks at the mouth of the Isthlwyn River. You've probably seen it...a small fishing boat. The crew were lucky and all escaped to the river banks.~
@634  = ~What about the demon?~
@635  = ~The same night as the shipwreck the mage climbed to the top of lighthouse and started some kind of incantation ritual. I don't know what and I guess it didn't work as he'd expected because some time later he came flying down the stairs in a fearful black rage.~
@636  = ~I stood back inside a small room as he almost ran down the stairs, then I took the opportunity to run up to the lamp room meaning to light the lamp to give at least a few hours' warning to the ships.~
@637  = ~I had just reached the lamp room when there was a lightening of the air, a foul stink and suddenly a tunnel to the bowels of the Nine Hells appeared. I saw the demon begin to step through but I wasn't waiting around any longer. I don't even really remember getting in here - it seems like forever I was hiding under that bench.~
@638  = ~What happened to the mage? - Olren of Thay, did you call him?~
@639  = ~A nice tale! And where is this mage now? Fled far, no doubt, as all Wizards of Thay are prone to doing at the first sight of trouble!~
@640  = ~I don't know. I didn't see him again after he passed me on the stairs.~
@641  = ~If the demon is still there it could be quite nasty after all this time. Thank you my friend - we will look into this.~
@642  = ~Haw! I like your tale, lighthouse keeper. Maybe you'd better cower here a little longer while we investigate the truth of it.~
@643  = ~The door to the lighthouse is locked. We tried it~
@644  = ~Locked? I don't remember doing that! But then I don't remember much about that night - two nights ago, was it? I don't remember. Everything is so blurred with fear. But here - look! I still have the key!~
@645  = ~Thank you my friend - we cannot promise to succeed but we do promise to help.~
@646  = ~Obnoxious idiot. Why didn't you say you had it? Gah!!~
@647  = ~Welcome! Welcome! I'm so pleased to see you again!~
@648  = ~Ah! You have stayed here then?~
@649  = ~The rat's back in his trap then, eh?~
@650  = ~Well, after you had stopped the Red Wizards, all returned to normal. I had no reason to leave the village.~
@651  = ~I suppose not. The lighthouse is fully operational again?~
@652  = ~Yes, it is! After the demon went, the cage with the beacon in it re-appeared back on the pedestal. I've just lit the beacon - go on up and see for yourselves.~
@653  = ~We will do that~
@654  = ~Not now - I don't really have the time.~
@655  = ~Ah, that's a pity - maybe some other time. It really is worth seeing - especially if you are on the deck of a ship!~
@656  = ~True, true.~
@657  = ~By the way, do you know what became of that demon?~
@658  = ~The tanar'ri? Yes - I helped him return to his own plane. After all, it wasn't his fault he was here in the first place.~
@659  = ~Oh, good. I don't wish to be rude but if you will please excuse me now, I need find my son and get more wood for the beacon. It burns quite a lot in a night.~
@660  = ~Certainly.~
@661  = ~There really is no need to be that insulting!~
@662  = ~Ar, perhaps not. It was a tough enough fight to clear this place out.~
@663  = ~Well, thanks to you, the beacon is back and is burning again.~
@664  = ~Fewer shipwrecks to loot, eh?~
@665  = ~You really are an obnoxious bastard, aren't you <PRO_RACE>? The sooner you leave my house, the happier I will be!~

@758  = ~And you need mine, <PRO_RACE>, even more than I need yours. I have told you that I can wait for another of your kind to come along, someone more biddable. Go away, little ghoul. Go and play with the other shambling corpses.~
@759  = ~So you don't want the key then?~
@760  = ~Ahhhh!! The key! The KEY!!! TSSSS! I can almost taste it!! Ahhhhhh!!! *GIVE IT TO ME*!!!!!~
@761  = ~With pleasure. There you are.~
@762  = ~Certainly. You have not forgotten about my reward?~
@763  = ~Ooo no. It's such a delicate little thing and sooo easily snapped. What's it worth?~
@764  = ~I was not mistaken about your honour then, <PRO_RACE>. Such a little thing and so lacking in your race.~
@765  = ~I am not sure that my concept of honour and your concept of honour are one and the same. However, go in peace to the Abyss, tanar'ri - you have been trapped here long enough.~
@766  = ~Reward? Ha! Always looking to line your pockets, eh <PRO_RACE>? Tsss - is honour not enough for you?~
@767  = ~Honour puts no food in your mouth, demon.~
@768  = ~Your life, you snivelling little rat of a <PRO_RACE>!!!! Give it here NOW!!!!~
@769  = ~Hehe. Oh no - I'm wise to you, tanar'ri. I'll be out that door before you can move. No more fireballing me, you stinking little demon.~
@770  = ~Ha! I choose to keep my word that I would tell you what I know of the madness in this town. The Red Wizard was not working alone.~
@771  = ~Ahhhh! Go on~
@772  = ~TSSSHA!!!! A good reply, <PRO_RACE>! However, I have no gold to give you, only the information you so dearly want - and what might be in this chest behind me. The Red Wizard was not working alone.~
@773  = ~Do you wish to try me, <PRO_RACE>? Say, how many of your misbegotten companions I can get before you make that door?~
@774  = ~Errrrr - I was only joking. Really, I didn't mean it. Honest. Here's your key.~
@775  = ~Do you wish to try me, <PRO_RACE>? Say, can I get your misbegotten companion before you make that door?~
@776  = ~Errrrr - I was only joking.  Really, I didn't mean it. Honest. Here's your key.~
@777  = ~Do you wish to try me, <PRO_RACE>? Say, can you get to that door before I get to you?~
@778  = ~Errrrr - I was only joking.  Really, I didn't mean it. Honest. Here's your precious key.~
@779  = ~-TSSSUT!!- You are filled with more foul wind than a sea-rotted corpse and you have a stink to go with it. I chose to be bound by my word - for now - and you shall have the information you want. The Red Wizard was not working alone.~
@780  = ~A Red Wizard not working alone? Now that will be a first!~
@781  = ~Yess. This Olren of Thay was a boastful little creature and he talked over much.~
@782  = ~Hold on one moment! You said he was killed by the spell when it went wrong.~
@783  = ~Ssss - you don't understand magic, do you? How to summon demons *properly*? -sss- He opened the portal to the Abyss for three days. Ha! I was too close and was caught by his spell as the portal came into being down in the Abyss. He sought to capture four of the tanar'ri.~
@784  = ~*WHAT!!!!* What in the Hell's Name did he want *four* tanar'ri for?? To set himself up as the ruler of another Ettabbar??~
@785  = ~-ssst!- What did it say? It mutters so badly.~
@786  = ~Shut up, Edwin. Well, demon, was that his idea? Another Ettabar?~
@787  = ~-ssst!- Close, <PRO_RACE>, so very close. Does the name Odesseiron mean anything to you?~
@788  = ~What of it?~
@789  = ~-ssst!!- So the name means something to you, does it, Red Wizard?~
@790  = ~Edwin, shut UP! What of it?~
@791  = ~Gold. He needs gold to support those vast armies.~
@792  = ~So he needed you to guard a waggon train of gold? Is that it? How much gold is in that train?~
@793  = ~No <PRO_RACE>, not gold. Something lighter and easier to transport than gold; turns into gold very easily; is dark and light and comes from the sun far to the south.~
@794  = ~Will you stop with the riddles, demon, and just tell me!~
@795  = ~-sss-ss- -ssheh-ss- hehehe. Impatient little <PRO_RACE>, aren't we? Calimshan's most precious export - the Black Lotus. Four waggonloads of it, bound for Athkatla, Nashkel, Beregost and Baldur's Gate.~
@796  = ~Black Lotus? Four waggonloads of Black Lotus? *Now* I begin to understand. Much against your will, demon, I think you have done us a great service this day.~
@797  = ~ -sss-ssut!- Not against my will. I care nothing for this Odesseiron but if you disrupt his plans I will be revenged against the idiot downstairs.~
@798  = ~Do you know where these waggons were going?~
@799  = ~ -tss- You mean; where are they going to hide? -sss- speak clearly, <PRO_RACE>. The Red Wizard talked of the old stronghold of Cerendor.~
@800  = ~Cerendor Hold, eh! North of Crimmor, if I recall rightly.~
@801  = ~Cerendor Hold?~
@802  = ~-TSUT!! I care not if you 'recall rightly' or not! -ss-ssss- ! One last thing for you, <PRO_RACE>; that fool of a Red Wizard dropped this in his haste to get away from me. Now, go!! My patience has grown very thin and the Abyss calls. GO!!!~
@803  = ~Very well. I never thought I'd say this to a demon either, but: I thank you for your help.~
@804  = ~-ssss-hehehe-ss- Somewhere else for you to find, <PRO_RACE>.  One last thing for you; that fool of a Red Wizard dropped this in his haste to get away from me. Now go!! My patience has grown very thin and the Abyss calls. GO!!!~
@805  = ~What brings you back here now???? -ssss- speak quickly before I grow tired of your presence.~
@806  = ~The Cowled Wizards have taken Ceinwen Ravenhair to Spellhold - or what's left of it. One of the inmates called Jon Irenicus had managed to take over the place and he wanted to keep me there too. In the resulting chaos he fled and Spellhold was all but destroyed.~
@807  = ~Ceinwen Ravenhair has been taken to Spellhold - or what's left of it. The inmates -er- got out and made a bit of a mess of the place - with my help, of course.~
@808  = ~Irenicus...Irenicus... -ssss- I keep hearing that name too often for my liking. Spellhold ruined? -sssut!- and about time. You had a hand in it did you? Maybe I have underestimated you, <PRO_RACE>. But Ceinwen Ravenhair is now beyond your reach?~
@809  = ~That's about the size of it. Beyond your reach too, I'd wager.~
@810  = ~RrrrraaaaAAARRGHHHH!!!!! TSSSS!! RRRRR!!! Taken to Spellhold???? Arrr- -ssss- those cowled fools will *suffer* for this -tssssk- SUFFER!!~
@811  = ~Truly for once, both you and I are in agreement.~
@812  = ~Don't push it, <PRO_RACE>. Did she tell you how she got past the Traps of the Living?~
@813  = ~No, she didn't. She gave us no hint of it.~
@814  = ~Well what do you think, demon?~
@815  = ~I have just the thing for you, <PRO_RACE>. It's called a Wizard Fireball - would you like it?~
@816  = ~Er - if it's all the same to you, I'll give it a miss, thank you.~
@817  = ~Then keep your uncivil tongue behind your stinking, rotted teeth. Next time I will throw first and think about it afterwards.~
@818  = ~It pains me to say this <PRO_RACE> but my only chance now is for you to find that fat red wizard that calls himself the Chosen of Mystra.~
@819  = ~Oho! Elminster - it was he that sent us down here in the first place!~
@820  = ~Yesss - Elminster. Do not return until you have that key - or do not return at all. It makes no difference to me.~
@821  = ~Go! Before I let loose the fury of the Demons of Fire! You have not the key and I have nothing to say to you! BEGONE!!!!~
@822  = ~At once.~
@823  = ~What? Who soils my name with their foul tongue, eh, reptile?~
@824  = ~(Now that would be a good trick if he could manage it)~
@825  = ~Ah! My uncle Tomak told me about Cerendor Hold. He said some of the best turnips in eastern Amn grow near there, at a place called Crimmor. He was foraging on the north bank of the Alandor River when these guards came upon him and dragged him off to the tower. Uncle Tomak spent a very uncomfortable night there and in the morning - ~
@826  = ~NO!!!~
@827  = ~What? Did you speak?~
@828  = ~Ah - an accident I do assure you (but I wish it had not been).~
@829  = ~You know, a little turnip soup cures most things, including incontinence of the voice. I could make you some if you want?~
@830  = ~No, no, I assure you I am alright (and would be better still if you would plant yourself and become a turnip too. Gah!)~
@831  = ~Oh, maybe I'll make you that soup anyway. It will do you a world of good. If you're really lucky, it might even soothe that vocal constipation of yours. All that muttering - it can't be good for your spellcasting you know. Shout it out loud and clear and let the enemy have it!~
@832  = ~A long distance to fly, my sparrow; across the Alandor River and north of Crimmor. May your wings be strong, for they will need to be.~
@833  = ~I know it well, as it happens. It is on the north bank of the Alandor River, outside the walls of the caravan town of Crimmor. It guards an entrance to the Cloudpeak Mountains.~
@834  = ~Bah! Cerendor! Some rivven filth tried to capture me there and failed. I know it only too well; north of the dirty rivven hole called Crimmor.~
@835  = ~Cerendor Hold is near the caravan town of Crimmor. They had good stout walls at one time, or so it is said in the Order. I do not know if that is so now.~
@836  = ~You can be sure the walls are still strong for you, Sir Knight. Cerendor Hold belongs to the D'Arnise family.~
@837  = ~Ooo - Boo says we have been there, don't you, Boo? He says we travelled there with Dynaheir, to the town of Crimmor where so many caravans pass through. Boo didn't like Crimmor, did you Boo? Too many people.~
@838  = ~I have heard terrible things of that place. A dark fortress that guards the path into the Cloudpeak Mountains, north of the town of Crimmor.~
@839  = ~Then it should suit your dark heart well, Bounty Hunter, should it not?~
@840  = ~It is an old fortress of the Order of the Radiant Heart, on the north bank of the Alandor River that runs north of the caravan town of Crimmor. It guards one entrance to the Cloud Peak Mountains.~
@841  = ~Cerendor Hold belongs to the D'Arnise family now. My grandfather bought it when the Radiant Heart abandoned the place and he restored it.~
@842  = ~Then I look forward to seeing it, my lady.~
@843  = ~A place of dark walls and dark memories. I travelled there once; I had business with a Caravan Master in Crimmor and I was curious. I have no wish for a speedy return.~
@844  = ~Cerendor Hold! It stands against the Cloudpeak Mountains, north of Crimmor. I know the place well; it's on the north bank of the Alandor River.~
@845  = ~More stone walls made to crush the forest. I saw it once when I had need to travel to the town of Crimmor - I do not wish to return - but if we must...~
@846  = ~Cerendor Hold is near the caravan town of Crimmor - my family used to own it. We must hurry - we can't let the Black Lotus fall into the hands of the underworld and make unwitting addicts of the poor. They have little enough money as it is without lining the pockets of criminals.~
@847  = ~Ah! My uncle Tomak told me about Cerendor Hold. He said some of the best turnips in eastern Amn grow near there, at a place called Crimmor. He was foraging on the north bank of the Alandor River when these guards came upon him and dragged him off to the tower. Uncle Tomak spent a very uncomfortable night there and in the morning - oh. Oh. You're not listening, are you?~
@848  = ~Oh no - another long walk. I remember Gorion saying Cerendor Hold was on the north bank of the Alandor River, somewhere near a place called Crimmor.~
@849  = ~(Oh no - not another night in the company of these simians) Cerendor Hold is north of the caravan town of Crimmor. It is said that the Tharch of Pyarados once had an interest in it.~
@850  = ~Oh my - I don't want to go there. The men who captured me forced us to stay there while they went into the town of Crimmor. I really don't want to go back there again.~
@851  = ~Ha! It's near the town of Crimmor which has the worst alehouses in eastern Amn. Had a few problems with uncooperative Caravan Masters there too.~

@992  = ~It depends on whether you are willing to pay for those few minutes, old man.~
@993  = ~Be off with you! I have no time to spend for the likes of a vagabond such as you!~
@994  = ~Old I may be but at least my wits are still sharp and my tongue is pleasant! With Mystra's help and if you live to be old enough, you too may one day reach that state. However, if you insist on shouting your greed at every person who wishes to greet you, you are likely to run afoul of the Nine Hells first!~
@995  = ~Please, forgive us. We are tired and weary, and weary travellers do not think well or softly. I am <CHARNAME> and you are, sir?~
@996  = ~Away to the Nine Hells yourself. We have neither the time nor the inclination to listen to you.~
@997  = ~I am Lief Torman, mage, occasional companion to Volo Geddarm and distant acquaintance of Elminster of Shadowdale. I would ask a favour of you, if you would be willing to hear. A small favour, nothing too great.~
@998  = ~As it happens, I know Elminster. Speak on - I am listening.~
@999  = ~I would be grateful if you could deliver a message for me. A message to Elminster himself. The problem is I have no idea where he may be found and so I have been asking all who pass through Athkatla if they would carry this message.~

@1002 = ~So be it. Your refusal is no loss.~
@1003 = ~It is important to me and I think it may be important to Elminster, but only he can decide that.~
@1004 = ~Very well, Lief, we will carry your message and will deliver it if we can. I do not promise delivery, mind!~
@1005 = ~Courteous words will often remove the sting of a refusal. I wish you good fortune upon your Bhaalspawn quest and may Mystra's Blessing be upon you.~
@1006 = ~That is enough for me. But hold for one moment - I would give you Mystra's Blessing before I go~
@1007 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, is it not? May I ask if you would be willing to carry a message for me now? I admit, I am getting a little desperate to contact Elminster and it seems that so far, no-one has found him!~
@1008 = ~I do not have the time. Maybe in the future.~
@1009 = ~Certainly. I regret that I could not do so earlier. I recently met Elminster in Trademeet; he stated his intention of staying there for a short while - I think he wanted to investigate further the recent wild animal problem~
@1010 = ~Oh! I am disappointed but no matter. I am sure that if I ask enough people, someone will get the message through.~

@1055 = ~No. No, I don't think so.~
@1056 = ~Not yet, anyway. It depends on how co-operative you are.~
@1057 = ~Co-operative, eh? What do you want stealing? A Red Wizard's cloak? Mushrooms from the kitchen? How about Lord Wultheof's new sword? Or is there something else you want? Eh?~
@1058 = ~Just shut up, will you? I can't abide chattering gnomes!~
@1059 = ~That's alright then. My old mother would never forgive me if I got myself killed.~
@1060 = ~What are you doing here anyway?~
@1061 = ~Hiding from those terrible Red Guards. One of them threatened to spit me with his sword if he ever saw me again. All I did was take some food from the table in the common dining room. Said he hated gnomes, especially those svnif-swine from the deeps.~
@1062 = ~Have you any idea how many Red Guards there are?~
@1063 = ~Too many. That was when they'd only been here three days and I've been hiding ever since. Thieving *is* the game - it's the only way I've been able to survive. I tried to escape out of the Hold a few times but each time I was afraid that he'd see me and I ran back here. He did see me once but a big human is too slow for a small gnome like me.~
@1064 = ~How have you stayed hidden for so long?~
@1065 = ~Oh, that was easy. Nobody ever comes here because they think this tower is haunted but I've never seen no ghosts. Any noise I make probably makes 'em believe it even more - stupid humans. Good job there's no elves in them Red Guards - elves love talking to ghosts.~
@1066 = ~Okay Cado. We're going to clean the rats out of the nest here one way or another, so you stay hidden for now.~
@1067 = ~Really? That's the first hope I've had for weeks! Don't worry - I won't let them see me!~
@1068 = ~Well, that's alright then. I'll - make my way quietly out. Bye!~
@1069 = ~Is it safe to come out yet?~
@1070 = ~No, you stay here for now.~
@1071 = ~Yes - the Red Guards are dead. Just keep out of trouble with the cook.~

@1105 = ~I'm just the local woodsman around here. There used to be more of us but one guy got killed and the other two moved away. The guy that got killed - he wasn't the brightest, you know. What was his name now? - ah! that was it! Garalt - and he had two mates; Ledban and Sheamus.~
@1106 = ~Look, is this relevant?~
@1107 = ~Just tell me where this man Trimthorn is.~
@1108 = ~Well, it might not be but you never know.~
@1109 = ~Alright, go on then.~
@1110 = ~Just tell me where Kalun Trimthorn is, if you know.~
@1111 = ~Aye...as I was saying, Garalt wasn't the brightest star in the sky - funny thing about him was he couldn't pronounce the letter 'h' so most of the time he didn't bother. We all understood him so it didn't bother us none either. Trouble was, Garalt couldn't keep a job for very long and he was always looking for work and as often as not, either Ledban or Sheamus would be along with him.~
@1112 = ~They were out in the forest here looking for a bit of work when they happened to pass this house here. Garalt sees a notice on the gate and ever curious, goes up to read it. Suddenly he gets really excited and starts shouting.~
@1113 = ~I think it was Ledban with him that day; anyway, Ledban goes over to him and says
       'What's up, Garalt?'
       'Would you look at t'is, Ledban' he says 't'ey wants workers 'ere'
So Ledban looks and sure enough, the notice says 'Tree fellers wanted'. Ledban brightened up immediately, thinking of all the ale that could be drunk on a few coppers a day; but then Garalt's face fell. A real picture it was, all sad and crumpled.
       'If only S'eamus was wit' us' Garalt sighed, 'we could apply for t'at job!'~

@1541 = ~I am <CHARNAME> and I've been asked by Elminster to investigate the disappearance of the villagers in Porthpentyrch. While we were there, we ran across a tanar'ri trapped in the lighthouse by the mage Olren of Thay. Olren is dead, killed by the same spell that trapped the tanar'ri.~
@1542 = ~And?~
@1543 = ~We had some trouble in a set of caves under the village. The tanar'ri said to talk to you as you were the only person ever to have successfully explored the caves.~
@1544 = ~Did he now? And what would a tanar'ri want by watching me?~
@1545 = ~He said you were the only person to have ever crossed the Traps of the Living.~
@1546 = ~I don't like bullies. The door is that way - use it.~
@1547 = ~*cough* uurghh - you and that tanar'ri are *cough* one from the same mould. Talos! Women and demons - is there any difference?~
@1548 = ~Tanar'ri? So you've been down to Porthpentyrch, have you? I take it you found the tanar'ri in the lighthouse?~
@1549 = ~So you are this Ceinwen Ravenhair. He said you could tell us how to cross the Traps of the Living.~
@1550 = ~The Traps of the Living? Do you know what you ask?~
@1551 = ~Evidently not. Why?~
@1552 = ~Because you have to be dead to cross them. Dead. Do you understand? Dead!~
@1553 = ~But you did it.~
@1554 = ~And you have NO idea what it cost me. It was THE most stupid thing I ever did - for NOTHING. What does this tanar'ri want?~
@1555 = ~He says there is a key in one of the far tombs that will help him return to his own plane of existence.~
@1556 = ~He wants to return home does he? - so would I in his position. He could be trapped there for an eternity in that time bubble; I would not like to be him. Very well; I will need to think on this. Return in twenty-four hours, <CHARNAME>, and I'll see what I can do.~
@1557 = ~Until tomorrow, Lady Ceinwen.~
@1558 = ~He wants to return home does he? Very well; I will need to think on this. Return in twenty-four hours - and bring some manners with you, <PRO_RACE>!~
@1559 = ~Maybe. Tomorrow then.~
@1560 = ~I said twenty-four hours! Now leave!~
@1561 = ~I said two days! Now leave!~
@1562 = ~Talk to these idiots - you'll probably get more sense out of them than I can.~
@1563 = ~I suppose I ought to thank you for that - four thousand gold pieces is a lot of money.~
@1564 = ~Hm - it's a lot of blackmail, more like.~
@1565 = ~And I'd be wanting it back if you were ever likely to put your hands on that much.~
@1566 = ~It is at that. One day someone will be able to do something about it but not for a long time yet, I'd guess. They're just too powerful.~
@1567 = ~And arrogant.~
@1568 = ~And arrogant. Still, I doubt you've any idea how grateful I am not to find myself in Spellhold. The last conversation we had, you were asking about the Traps of the Living down in Porthpentyrch?~
@1569 = ~Yes. I wanted to know how to cross them.~
@1570 = ~Then meet me at my home in about one hour's time - I have some things to attend to first before I can give you an answer.~
@1571 = ~Ha! Everyone has their price, so it seems. I daresay yours is how to cross the Traps of the Living, is it not, <PRO_RACE>?~
@1572 = ~That would be a good start.~
@1573 = ~Then meet me at my home in about one hour's time - I have some things to attend to first. And bring those manners with you <PRO_RACE> or you're likely to find you've just wasted four thousand gold pieces.~
@1574 = ~I thought I told that I didn't want to see you face again, <PRO_RACE> - ever!~
@1575 = ~Well, lady, it seems you don't have much choice and nor do I. Elminster put me up to this and stupidly, I accepted.~
@1576 = ~Elminster? Why didn't you say so?~
@1577 = ~I thought I did - or maybe I just thought that I thought I did. And my name is <CHARNAME>, lady, not <PRO_RACE>.~
@1578 = ~Alright, <CHARNAME>, you need to cross the Traps of the Living and to do that, you need to be dead. To be dead and not dead, you have to be undead. Have I made myself completely clear? Do you understand where this is leading?~
@1579 = ~So far~
@1580 = ~I did it once - you know that - and in Mystra's Name I still wish that I had not. I became obsessed with crossing the Traps of the Living to see what was beyond and when one day I managed to sneak into Durlag's Tower and return with a necromancer's spellbook, I thought I had it made.~
@1581 = ~Who was the necromancer?~
@1582 = ~I don't know - someone long dead who had not left his name on the book. Maybe he stole it from someone else; whatever, it was now in my possession and I could not believe my luck when I found inscribed within it a spell called the Ghoul's Bed. A way to be undead for a short while - *if* you got it right.~
@1583 = ~And you got it right?~
@1584 = ~No. Or yes. It depends on your point of view. From my point of view, it was no. It took me months to collect and distill the ingredients for the potion to go with the spell, then I hurried back to Porthpentyrch, went down into the caves, slid silently passed the watchers down there and cast the spell.~
@1585 = ~The necromancer states that it will make you undead without effect for up to two hours. After that, the disease progresses until within six hours you are undead permanently. No return, no death, no nothing....~
@1586 = ~Oh, I thought I was so clever. I passed over the Traps and into the dwarf-lord's tomb - straight into his protectors. Why I had thought that the dwarf-lord would not be protected beyond the Traps is a question that still haunts me. The sword caught me high in the ribs - a killing blow, only the irony was that I was already dead.~
@1587 = ~It was pain like I had never experienced before; no-one should experience that and live. No-one, do you understand? I turned and I ran - stumbled - crashed - fell - crawled - back beyond the Traps; an undead creature, dying. Oh, but I got to the antidote but just. Only just.~
@1588 = ~I lay there for three days, saved only by the water from the river I lay next to, while the antidote returned me to normal. I had to endure the pain for two days until the Ghoul's Bed had worn off enough so that I could use a Potion of Healing. After that, I came home, beaten in spirit and with a lesson in humility that is impossible to forget. No more necromancy - never again. Never. I now work only for Mystra.~
@1589 = ~But you could still help us?~
@1590 = ~Reluctantly - yes. Hard as it may be to believe, I kept the spellbook, the Ghoul's Bed potion and the antidote to remind me of what pride is capable of - as if I really needed reminding.~
@1591 = ~Then we can have them?~
@1592 = ~It's not  quite as easy as that. I am missing one ingredient that will make the Ghoul's Bed active again; the blood of a vampire.~
@1593 = ~Ah. Which can be found where?~
@1594 = ~In a vampire, idiot. Rumour has it that a coven has taken up residence below the Graveyard. No, it's not a rumour - I know they're there - I can feel them. A legacy of the Ghoul's Bed I guess; either that, or a legacy of the undead wound.~
@1595 = ~There must be something more to it than that. Kill a vampire and it turns to gaseous form.~
@1596 = ~You're right. The vampire must be a child.~
@1597 = ~A child vampire? There is such a thing?~
@1598 = ~One was made this week - an event so rare that it makes me think the Bhaalspawn essence has a hand in it because it is too co-incidental for my peace of mind. Now you know why I am helping you; I want you to put that soul to rest in return. Take this blade and use it to kill the vampire. It is made of strengthened silver, specially hardened and hollowed to collect the blood as the vampire changes to the gaseous form. The silver is lethal to new vampires; the blow that collects the blood will also destroy the vampire.~
@1599 = ~We will give the child peace - no child deserves that fate.~
@1600 = ~Yes, I felt the death of the child and I am glad - it was well done. But you did not kill her with the knife I gave you and without the blood of that vampire, I cannot create the Ghoul's Bed potion. My help for you is at an end.~
@1601 = ~Thank you - the child is now at peace. I confess that I do not want to do this but I have made my promise. I ask you again - do you truly understand what you are taking on? Do you understand what this can do to you if it is mishandled? You cannot pass this off onto one of your companions - this will work for you and for you only.~
@1602 = ~I understand, Lady Ceinwen. I have undertaken an obligation to do this.~
@1603 = ~Just do it, lady - I can handle it.~
@1604 = ~Very well <CHARNAME> - come back in two days and I will have it ready for you.~
@1605 = ~You are still determined to go ahead then? Despite my warnings?~
@1606 = ~Just give me the stuff.~
@1607 = ~Then here it is - the Ghoul's Bed and its antidote. Wait until you are on the edge of the Traps of the Living; you must then swallow the potion to pass the Traps. Remember; you have just two hours before you must take the antidote or remain undead forever. When you have taken the antidote, its effects will last up to three days. I will not wish you luck, for I doubt that luck has anything to do with it.~
@1608 = ~Thank you, Lady Ceinwen. May Mystra guard you.~
@1609 = ~Then here it is - the Ghoul's Bed and its antidote. Wait until you are on the edge of the Traps of the Living; you must then swallow the potion to pass the Traps. Remember; you have just two hours before you must take the antidote or remain undead forever. The effects of the antidote will last up to three days. I have filled my obligation to you and I do not wish to see you again. Now go.~
@1610 = ~Agh - ! Wait - I know you. You did not listen, did you? For all of my warnings, you did not listen. I cannot help you <CHARNAME> and there is no-one who can.~
@1611 = ~ Unless - unless - maybe.. but where...?~
@1612 = ~'Where' what, Lady Ceinwen?~
@1613 = ~Spit it out you stupid hedge-witch!~
@1614 = ~One of the Chosen may be able to help, but I do not know where to find any of them. They could be scattered to the four winds of Faerun for all I know of their whereabouts.~
@1615 = ~Ah! But I think I know where I can find Elminster. Thank you, Lady Ceinwen.~
@1616 = ~You dare come here to insult me and demand that I help you after you have completely ignored all of my instructions? Your arrogance is unbelievable!!~
@1617 = ~Tell me where I can find help, hedge-witch, before I tear your head from your shoulders!~
@1618 = ~Fool. Idiot. Death has no fear for me - I already live on borrowed time. One of Mystra's Chosen may possibly have an answer to your stupidity but I don't and better than that, I have no idea where any of them are! Now get you gone from here; the stench you bring with you is worse than that of the grave.~
@1619 = ~Ha! Mystra's Chosen eh? It just so happens I know where that meddling fool Elminster is. Drunk in his cups again, no doubt. You can keep your head Ceinwen Ravenhair - this time.~

//Ailoth Tam - Red Wizard
@1620 = ~No! Hold your hand!~
@1621 = ~And who are you, Red Wizard, that we should talk to you?~
@1622 = ~I am Ailoth Tam, Red Wizard of Thay. I was with the caravan that captured Cerendor Hold.~
@1623 = ~I know that. You still haven't convinced me.~
@1624 = ~That is a good reason to kill you, not one to keep you alive!~
@1625 = ~But I can tell you what is happening here!~
@1626 = ~You've just bought your life - for now. Start talking.~
@1627 = ~Cerendor Hold sits astride the trade routes between Thay and the Sword Coast; my master needs money to fund his armies and entered into an agreement with the Pasha Baadilhaela to ship the Black Lotus from Calimport to Athkatla.~
@1628 = ~Pasha Baadilhaela? Who's he?~
@1629 = ~One of two feuding wizards in Calimport. The other is Khariyl the Winged.~
@1630 = ~And what does a feud in far Calimport have to do with Thay?~
@1631 = ~Pasha Baadilhaela also needs money for bribes to continue his feud. My master got to hear of this and proposed an alliance; Pasha Baadilhaela was to supply Black Lotus and my master would help distribute it.~
@1632 = ~Your master - who is he?~
@1633 = ~If I tell you that I will die!! Please - do not make me say his name!~
@1634 = ~Then I will tell you. Homen Odesseiron - is that the name you will not speak?~
@1635 = ~No! Do not ask me - you have a Red Wizard with you and if my master gets to hear that his name has been spoken, I will wish a thousand times that I was dead!~
@1636 = ~Then I will say it - Homen Odesseiron.~
@1637 = ~What is he saying?~
@1638 = ~Shut up, Edwin. You! keep talking.~
@1639 = ~I did not say that name! You cannot make me admit it!~
@1640 = ~So Homen Odesseiron came up with the idea of using isolated Cerendor Hold, which just happens to be not that far off the main caravan and river routes, as a staging post. How does the drug come up river? By barge?~
@1641 = ~You will wish you had...... So either Homen Odesseiron or this Pasha Baadilhaela had the brilliant idea of using Cerendor Hold as a stopping off and transfer point? Who was it?~
@1642 = ~It was Pasha Baadilhaela's idea.~
@1643 = ~What does all this have to do with the tanar'ri in the lighthouse at Porthpentyrch?~
@1644 = ~That was Olren Dreltaralian's idea - to summon four tanar'ri to help guard the caravan. I do not know what went wrong.~
@1645 = ~Ah - but you can help put it right, can't you?~
@1646 = ~I cannot close the portal - I don't know how!~
@1647 = ~Who does?~
@1648 = ~The portal is still open? - !~
@1649 = ~So I suspect.~
@1650 = ~No! Do not make me! I cannot - I do not have the strength or knowledge!~
@1651 = ~Garalial Geltarath.~
@1652 = ~Garalial Geltarath? Where can I find him? And what is he to you?~
@1653 = ~He is not to be treated lightly, that I know.~
@1654 = ~Ahhhh - a harper; or rather, an ex-harper. And where can he be found?~
@1655 = ~The last I knew of him he was still living in Athkatla. He is nothing to me beyond information; I know him as an ex-Harper who has learned much about the undead.~
@1656 = ~Where in Athkatla??~
@1657 = ~In the Government District.~
@1658 = ~In the *Government* District?~
@1659 = ~Be sure that if he is not there I will be back for you. Tell me, who is in charge of the drug caravan?~
@1660 = ~That's what he says. He lives in one of the houses under the Southgate Wall.~
@1661 = ~You've been there, have you? Directions - quickly!~
@1662 = ~Yes, yes. The south side of the Slum District - there's a ruined house there - you can see the Southgate Wall from behind it. Go east from the house and it will take you to the harper's house.~
@1663 = ~I see. Be sure that if he is not there I will be back for you. One last question for you, Ailoth Tam; who is in charge of the drug caravan?~
@1664 = ~Mordaran Rockfist; one of the Duergar. His lieutenant is an ex-Amnish soldier, Maredudd Bengoch by name.~
@1665 = ~A Duergar? And a Moonshae Islander by his name! Where are they heading?~
@1666 = ~Rockfist is staying with the caravan and Bengoch is heading for the docks; I don't know if he is meeting anyone. He kept that information very close. All he said was that it was the trans-shipment point for Baldur's Gate.~
@1667 = ~Ha! Very funny. Well, Ailoth Tam, you have bought your life but at a cost. You will be held here until I send word that you are to be released; after that, get you out of the Sword Coast and if I ever hear of you here again, I'm sure Homen Odesseiron will be very interested in your part in these proceedings.~
@1668 = ~Ha! Very funny. Well, Ailoth Tam, you have bought your life but at a cost. You will be held here until I send word that you are to be released; after that, get you out of the Sword Coast and be assured that both I and the Harpers will be listening very closely for any news of your unwanted return.~
@1669 = ~Ha! Are you so afraid of the name Odesseiron? (All sensible people are).~
@1670 = ~Only if his miserable skin does not shrivel at the thought. The tanar'ri may have gone but the portal still remains open if not visible. He must close it.~
@1671 = ~WHAT???!!!! Foul carrion! That despicable retarded offspring of a diseased harpy? That - that - oh, I have no names for a renegade harper such as he! Be careful of him <CHARNAME>; he does indeed have powerful dark magic and do not, under ANY circumstances, trust him.~

@1705 = ~Can you heal us?~
@1706 = ~Can you heal me?~
@1707 = ~Farewell for now.~
@1708 = ~Not a great deal. They came in with the last caravan from Calimshan and simply never went out again; before we really knew what was happening they had taken over the Hold.~
@1709 = ~Did it affect you?~
@1710 = ~On a day-to-day basis, no. Long term though, it certainly will. I also expect that the authorities in Crimmor will begin to wonder what's happening up here sooner or later.~
@1711 = ~What about reporting back to your temple?~
@1712 = ~I have only recently arrived here myself; I will not be missed for some months. There is one thing that may interest you though.~
@1713 = ~Go on...~
@1714 = ~One of the Red Wizards that stayed here does not look as certain as his fellows. I think this venture is a little over his head; his first mission, maybe.~
@1715 = ~What's his name?~
@1716 = ~Ailoth Tam. He's younger than the others by quite some years.~
@1717 = ~Thank you. Can you heal us?~
@1718 = ~Thank you. Can you heal me?~
@1719 = ~Thank you. Farewell for now~
@1720 = ~I am glad to see you survived the fight and I thank you in the Name of Helm for your help.~
@1721 = ~It was nothing; the garrison was ready to take the Hold back itself.~
@1722 = ~You couldn't have done it without me.~
@1723 = ~That's as maybe, but my thanks still remain.~
@1724 = ~Here you are. I have very few potions until the next caravan arrives from Athkatla.~

@1730 = ~Yes?~
@1731 = ~Are you the Guard Captain for Cerendor Hold?~
@1732 = ~If you're the Guard Captain then I'd like a word with you.~
@1733 = ~I am. How can I help you?~
@1734 = ~Can you tell me what's happening here?~
@1735 = ~What are the Red Wizards up to?~
@1736 = ~I'm not entirely sure but it looks as if the Red Wizards and their friends intend to use Cerendor Hold as a staging base for their smuggling operations.~
@1737 = ~Why?~
@1738 = ~How do you know?~
@1739 = ~Why? How would *I* know? I can make a few educated guesses though. You don't get to be Hold Captain with no brains, you know!~
@1740 = ~I'd be interested to hear you.~
@1741 = ~Look at the situation. Cerendor Hold sits at the entrance to one of the passes through the Cloudpeak Mountains. It used to be a major pass but the increasing size of caravan waggons restricts its use these days.~
@1742 = ~Consequently, we sit on a well maintained route that is not so frequently used and we can see who is approaching for great distances along both sides of the Pass. If you control Cerendor Hold, you control a valuable staging post and route along the Great Caravan Routes of Faerun.~
@1743 = ~The Hold is still in very good order and is *very* secure. In short, it is ideal for bring through goods that you would like as few people as possible to see. If the new 'owners' are clever enough, they can run the normal day-to-day business as well and no one will ever see the other side of it.~
@1744 = ~So why don't you just leave, tell someone and come back and re-take the Hold?~
@1745 = ~Anyone who leaves here and reports to any other authority will kiss goodbye to his life. If not his life, maybe one or more of his family - and not in a quick and easy death either. If the sword doesn't get him then the magecraft will.~
@1746 = ~I see. What are the Red Wizards up to?~
@1747 = ~I think they are in the operation of smuggling high-value, low-bulk goods along the Sword Coast.~
@1748 = ~And the origin of these high-value, low-bulk goods would be Calimshan, would it?~
@1749 = ~I value my life above the discussion of certain things.~
@1750 = ~Ah. Would you be willing to ...return... the Hold to its former owners?~
@1751 = ~Coward.~
@1752 = ~Coward, is it? Then perhaps you would like to be hung from the Hold Walls in a small cage with little food but plenty of water and no protection from the weather. Do you know how long it takes to die that way?~
@1753 = ~In the spring, many months of deprivation and suffering, growing weaker through lack of room and movement. The lucky ones get put there in the winter when the weather will kill you in a week.~
@1754 = ~Or perhaps you would like to go home one night and find the remains of your entire family after they have been eaten alive by werefolk. A coward, am I?~
@1755 = ~Well... put like that I withdraw my words. Would you be willing to ...return... the Hold to its former owners?~
@1756 = ~The decision to do that is not mine, although I will obey orders with enthusiasm, if you understand me.~
@1757 = ~I think I do, Captain. I will 'seek out' those orders.~
@1758 = ~I think that's all of the bastards good and dead. There might be one or two still skulking in dark corners but we'll soon have them join their friends.~
@1759 = ~Are you sure of that?~
@1760 = ~That's a shame. I was looking forward to a bit more mayhem.~
@1761 = ~As sure as I can be. If you'll excuse me now, I need to find out if my serjeante survived and to see to my men.~
@1762 = ~As you will, Captain.~
@1763 = ~Mayhem - is that what you call it? I have dead and injured men in here and you look forward to more 'mayhem' - !~
@1764 = ~I had a score to settle against those Red Wizards and I didn't expect it to be over so quick.~
@1765 = ~Oh, keep quiet you old fool. At least you've got your hold back.~
@1766 = ~Aye - and I'm ashamed to admit we needed your oh so willingly given help. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have the remains of this 'mayhem' to clear up!~
@1767 = ~Be thankful you're still alive when so many are not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have the remains of this 'mayhem' to clear up!~
@1768 = ~My Family will reward your loyalty, Captain.~

@1864 = ~You must ask Derval that, <SIRMAAM>.~

//*************************************************************************
//Derval
@1870 = ~Greetings again, <SIRMAAM>! Do you wish to hear the Ramblings again?~
@1871 = ~Yes, I'd like that.~
@1872 = ~Err - not right now. Maybe some other time.~
@1873 = ~I pray you <SIRMAAM>, please be quiet while the lady plays.~
@1874 = ~Derval Cadarn, Bard of the Sword Coast, at your service <SIRMAAM>!~
@1875 = ~Derval Cadarn? Hmm. That name sounds familiar.~
@1876 = ~Never heard of you.~
@1877 = ~To be truthful - I doubt if anyone has. But it sounds good.~
@1878 = ~Hmph! A good introduction when all's said and done.~
@1879 = ~It sounds like you're an idiot.~
@1880 = ~I'll not disagree with that either.~
@1881 = ~Then why the flowery introduction?~
@1882 = ~Then why all the stupid hat-waving and made-up names?~
@1883 = ~I hope not, <SIRMAAM>. I'd rather stay not known, if you take my point.~
@1884 = ~Oh; it sounds good. For all that though, I'm a lousy bard anyway.~
@1885 = ~You're a - ! Okay, never mind. Was that you playing the piano when we came through the door?~
@1886 = ~No, it was Aine here. She plays well, doesn't she? The only problem is she can only remember the half of it.~
@1887 = ~Then if our guests here wish to hear the whole of the piece, I, Derval Cadarn, Bard of the Sword Coast, shall play it for them!~
@1888 = ~Then prepare to be amazed!!~
@1889 = ~Shh, my sweeting - you can get your own back on me later. There's a very comfortable hayloft around the back which would be just perfect for it. Now, listen!~
@1890 = ~One moment - what is the piece called?~
@1891 = ~Ah! Good point. I don't really know - I picked it up in the far west of the Moonshae Isles. I call it 'Aine's Peace'.~
@1892 = ~Thank you, Derval Cadarn; I thought the really awful puns were my province alone but it seems I'm sorely mistaken. Play on.~
@1893 = ~That's because you've only taught me the first part!~
@1894 = ~That's because you can't remember the second part, my sweeting.~
@1895 = ~Men! They never believe that you can be as good as them and the gods help you if you're ever better!~
@1896 = ~Sometimes I wish you were mazed. Permanently.~

//Morvans the Innkeeper
@1900 = ~For you my goods come with a special price. Do you wish to buy anything?~
@1901 = ~I was talking to your daughter, Aine. She said that you wouldn't tell her how you got the piano-~
@1902 = ~Thank you, yes.~
@1903 = ~Not at the moment, thank you~
@1904 = ~Ah! Welcome to the Blue Harpy Inn! Sit down my friends - take a seat.~
@1905 = ~Thank you - the rest will be welcome.~
@1906 = ~We're no friends of yours. We hardly know you.~
@1907 = ~Just a manner of speaking, you understand - no offense meant.~
@1908 = ~None taken. Forgive my sharp tongue - I am just a little tired from the road.~
@1909 = ~Next time be more careful with your 'manner of speaking'.~
@1910 = ~I understand. Do you wish to buy a drink or to sell any items?~
@1911 = ~Yes.~
@1912 = ~No.~
@1913 = ~How can I help you?~
@1914 = ~Why is it called the 'Blue Harpy Inn'?~
@1915 = ~What do you sell here?~
@1916 = ~The previous owner called it the Blue Harpy. He said it was a private joke that he refused to tell anyone, but the day he sold me the inn we got very drunk and I wheedled it out of him.~
@1917 = ~And?~
@1918 = ~I can't be bothered with long stories. What do you sell here?~
@1919 = ~Well, <SIRMAAM>, he said he named it after his wife - she'd screech like a Harpy until she was blue in the face.~
@1920 = ~Oh, right. That's a terrible joke.~
@1921 = ~I can't be bothered with this. What do you sell here?~
@1922 = ~Actually <SIRMAAM>, as I live, it's the truth.~
@1923 = ~How can I help you then?~
@1924 = ~-because it was a long story. Yes, yes - I know. The truth is, it isn't that much of a long story at all. I just told her that to make it more mysterious because she always wanted a piano, ever since she heard one being played in the Silverale Hall, Athkatla.~
@1925 = ~How did you come by it?~
@1926 = ~Oh. In that case I'm not really interested.~
@1927 = ~There was a small but well-armed and well-defended caravan passing through here a number of years ago, fleeing from a feud in Murann. I forget the name of the family now, but they were of noble birth and had a house in Athkatla where they intended to settle.~
@1928 = ~They had gotten safely through the Small Teeth Pass and were just north of Imnescar when they were ambushed; for the second time as it happened. They had already beaten off a group of bandits that had attacked them as they turned onto the Trade Way and on this day reasonably expected to make Purskal before nightfall.~
@1929 = ~Well, this group of bandits had somehow recruited a couple of ogres to fight for them. The gods know how they managed to bribe them but there it is. By all accounts it was a short and brutal battle but during it one of the waggons got badly damaged and they couldn't repair it on the road.~
@1930 = ~Somehow they got everything re-distributed onto the other waggons and began moving again. The decision was made to leave the Trade Way, give Purskal a miss and to continue to Athkatla via the Coast Way instead.~
@1931 = ~Why? Why didn't they go on to Purskal?~
@1932 = ~The fight hadn't gone entirely their way and they were carrying injured guards as well as overloaded waggons. As I was told the story, they had beaten off two groups of bandits and were now known to be weakened; a third attack may have succeeded. Bear in mind that this caravan was carrying the goods and chattels of an entire rich household; a very inviting target.~
@1933 = ~Don't forget that the long reach south of the Amnish merchants is relatively recent. Attacks on caravans of all sizes and shapes were a common occurance until the ruling of the present Council of Six in Athkatla. It was he who decided to defend the Trade Way as far south as Imnescar and as far north as Nashkel.~
@1934 = ~So less than a day after the second attack the caravan arrived here in Porthpentyrch. They were hoping to get the broken waggon repaired and to continue on as a whole caravan again but Einion the wainwright took one look at the damage and shook his head. The main bedribs were cracked.~
@1935 = ~I thought you said they left the broken waggon behind?~
@1936 = ~No. They took the yoke off, removed the broken front wheels and lifted the front onto the rear bed of another waggon. While Einion tried to procure the timbers to make new bedribs, the injured were cared for by the chirurgeon.~
@1937 = ~What!!! Porthpentyrch had a chirurgeon??!!!~
@1938 = ~Not quite. He was Einion's brother, apprentic'd and journey'd in Athkatla. He had come home to celebrate his election to the Guild of Chirurgeons. Bedwin; that was his name. Haven't heard or seen anything of him these five years.~
@1939 = ~So the day came when Einion finally had to admit defeat and confess that he could not get new timbers suitable for the bedribs. The young lord took this all in his stride and began deciding what would be left and what would continue on with them.~
@1940 = ~When I saw him hesitating over the piano I remembered the longing on young Aine's face and asked him if he would consider parting with it for a suitable sum. Well, Lathander bless him but he named a price that both he and I knew was well below its worth. We agreed the price there and then; it seems he had caught young Aine trying the play the instrument late one night and had seen the determination and love in the wee girl's eyes.~
@1941 = ~And that, my friends, is the story of how Aine came by her piano. Not long in the telling and not so mysterious after all.~
@1942 = ~But why won't you tell Aine?~
@1943 = ~The truth is I think she already knows but won't admit it. It's a game that's been going on for so long now that neither of us wants to end it.~
@1944 = ~Ahh - I understand. May I ask what you have for sale here?~
@1945 = ~Here's what's on offer.~

@1952 = ~Cooo - are you a real adventurer, mister?~
@1953 = ~You're a real lady adventurer - I can tell!~
@1954 = ~My daddy says he could have beaten the nasties with both arms tied behind his back and we didn't need no scabby adventurers.~
@1955 = ~When I grow up I'm gonna kill demons too!~
@1956 = ~My daddy says he's not staying in this pisspot town any longer. What's a pisspot, mister?~
@1957 = ~Can I come with you mister?~
@1958 = ~I like you lady - you're nice!~

//Girls
@1980 = ~My mummy says you're ever so handsome!~
@1981 = ~My mummy says you're ever so pretty!~
@1982 = ~Urghh!!! You're all nasty and smelly!~
@1983 = ~Were you ever so scared? I would be! I hate spiders. And snakes.~

@1985 = ~When I grow up I want to be a lady like you!~
@1986 = ~Go 'way! I don't want to talk to you!~

//Male house residents
@1990 = ~I hope you're not aiming on staying - I have to go now.~
@1991 = ~Who are you? This is a private house - please leave now.~
@1992 = ~I'm not sure I can help you, friend.~
@1993 = ~I'd offer you a place in my boat, only I've got a full crew.~
@1994 = ~I could really kill a pint of old Morvans' best ale.~
@1995 = ~I'm real glad you killed off those undead and restored the village. I was beginning to think we could never return!~
@1996 = ~There's nothing quite like me own home. You're welcome to sit with me if you want.~
@1997 = ~And you say there was a real demon in the lighthouse? Woo-hoo! I'm glad I never saw it!~
@1998 = ~Have you been into the Blue Harpy yet? Best ale this side of Baldur's Gate!~
@1999 = ~No fishin' today - no fishin' tomorrow. I'm havin' a few days onshore.~

//Female house residents
@2000 = ~Me 'usband's away at sea right now. Please come back some other time.~
@2001 = ~I know I can trust you - but me 'usband don't and 'e's a jealous man. I'd leave now if I were you.~
@2002 = ~I'm sure we can find someone nice to marry ye right quick, if ye like.~
@2003 = ~You 'aven't seen me daughter running around, 'ave you? Young urchin with a red dress and a blue hairband, she is.~
@2004 = ~Them kids need looking after - they're all always in one trouble or another.~
@2005 = ~If I catch my son in the fishbasket again, I'll smack 'is 'ead with a wet kipper, I will.~
@2006 = ~You need to talk to my husband - he's probably in the Blue Harpy as usual.~
@2007 = ~Have you heard that young Aine play the piano? She's good enough to play in the big houses of Athkatla, I say!~
@2008 = ~I'm not at all sure about that bard, Derval. He's like as not to get young Aine with child and then leave her.~
@2009 = ~I'll be along to the Blue Harpy meself in a few minutes. Just got to do me hair before I go.~

//Men
@2020 = ~Fishin's good now. Got a full catch yesterday, I did!~
@2021 = ~There's no more of those nasty undead wandering around here now, thanks to you!~
@2022 = ~Lookey here!! Heroes all!!!~
@2023 = ~Looks like the weather will hold for a while yet. I lost my mast in a storm last year and only just survived. Don't want it to happen again!!~
@2024 = ~We'll be away for the fishing later. Now Porthpentyrch is free from those creeping ghouls we can go to sea without fear again. Do you want to come too? Plenty for all!~
@2025 = ~The offer's good but I fear I'll get seasick.~
@2026 = ~Beugh! Just the smell from here makes me want to barf!~
@2027 = ~Not today, thank you.~
@2028 = ~Aye, maybe you're right. You're a good sort though - you're welcome to try me at any time if you have a desire to become a fisherman.~
@2029 = ~Aye - and you'd probably spend the whole time puking over the catch, poor delicate stomachs that you have!~
@2030 = ~Thank ye friends! Meet me in the inn later and I'll stand ye a few rounds!~
@2031 = ~Sounds good to me!~
@2032 = ~No thanks - I don't drink dirty smelly fish-ale.~
@2033 = ~Maybe later.~
@2034 = ~See you in there then! It's just a ways round the back there.~
@2035 = ~Suit yourself, ya dirty mercenary. I was simply trying to be friendly.~
@2036 = ~The catch has been mighty poor around here, as o' late.  Makes it hard for a poor fisherman to earn a living, it does.~
@2037 = ~Don't mind the smell...it's just a bit o' the last catch rubbed off on me.~
@2038 = ~Out on the boats all day...that's why I'm in here for a pint or two, aye?~
@2039 = ~Does ye know we encountered a huge beastie on me fishing boat last week?  Survived it, we did.  Helm must be watchin' over us.~
@2040 = ~Ay, now...why are ye looking so crossed-eye at me, hm? Or maybe it's me lookin' cross-eyed at you. Hard to tell after all that ale.~
@2041 = ~I don't know where all the bloody fish have gone.  Nets have been empty, as o' late and yet others have full catches.~
@2042 = ~(sigh)  I tells ye, what I wouldn't give t' be able to just twiddle me fingers and conjure up some fish.  The fishin's just been too bloody hard lately.~
@2043 = ~Aaaah, the gods must have somethin' against me, truly.  I work an' work, but we be nothin' ever but poor, poor, poor!~

//Women
@2050 = ~Hehe - back to gutting fish then, it is! At least we can sleep sound at nights now, thanks to you.~
@2051 = ~My hero! I've got a nice warm place for you if you want it.... *giggle*~
@2052 = ~Oooo.... now there's a nice-sounding offer!~
@2053 = ~Get away from me you dirty harlot!~
@2054 = ~I may come and find it later.~
@2055 = ~HAAAR!!! It's a loft full of hay to sleep in *giggle*~
@2056 = ~*SLAP!!!* DON'T call me a harlot! I'll fillet yer guts as clean as a fish.~
@2057 = ~It's been weeks since we could sleep quiet at night - you have no idea how good it feels now!~
@2058 = ~At last all those poor dead souls are resting peacefully, thanks to you. Who'd have thought it? - old dwarven ruins under Porthpentyrch!~
@2059 = ~<CHARNAME>! Do ye need anyone more in your party - say to keep your bed warm at night?~
@2060 = ~Along with the snakes and spiders....?~
@2061 = ~Away with you, you shameless scarlet hussy!~
@2062 = ~Only if you have five years' experience and the piece of paper to prove it.~
@2063 = ~*SHRIEK!* Sorry - I've just remembered - I've got too much to do here in Porthpentyrch. Maybe next year if you're passing by again.~
@2064 = ~I was only joking! I hope the next Ankheg you meet burns your eyes out!~
@2065 = ~Oooo - look at those muscles! I'd marry ye if I wasn't already!~
@2066 = ~Oooo <CHARNAME>! - my shining hero! Would you like me to play with your sword...? *giggle*~
@2067 = ~Well now my pretty young lady - there's a sharp offer!~
@2068 = ~Get away from me, dirty fishwife! Take your filthy mind elsewhere!~
@2069 = ~No thank you - my sword's my own.~
@2070 = ~HAAAR!!! I bet it's a good sword too - but me 'usband would kill me if 'e found me playing with other men's weapons! *giggle*~
@2071 = ~*SLAP!!!* There's nothing so dirty as them that acts righteous and looks down on the rest of us! I hopes you loses yer balls to a syrene!~

//Fishwife
@2080 = ~I be tellin' ye... I knows me husband says he be fishin' all day... but I think for certain he's hiding in the Blue Harpy!~
@2081 = ~I can clean and gut a fish faster than ye can blink... ye can find our goods down at th' market in Naskel every day, you can.~
@2082 = ~Helm watch over us!  I was just hangin' the bloody laundry and where does ye think me kids have gone?  Vanished!  When I get ahold of 'em...~
@2083 = ~You be careful in these parts, I be warning ye!  There be a demon on the loose!~
@2084 = ~So... you be the one that solved the undead problem, aye?  What... you be lookin' fer applause?  You'll not find it here!~
@2085 = ~What are ye looking at?!  Keep yer eyeballs in yer head or ye'll feel my rolling pin, sure enough!~
@2086 = ~I see you there, gnome!  You and your ilk are nothing but drunken garbage, keepin' me husband away all hours of the night with yer tales!  Begone!~
@2087 = ~You there!  Struttin' around in yer fancy armor!  Why doesn't ye go do something useful and gather up all the street thieves and cutpurses, eh?!~

//Fishermen
@2090 = ~The catch has been mighty poor around here, as o' late.  Makes it hard for a poor fisherman to earn a living, it does.~
@2091 = ~Don't mind the smell... it's just a bit o' the last catch rubbed off on me.~
@2092 = ~Out on the boats all day... I think I'll be headin' down to the Blue Harpy for a pint or two, aye?~
@2093 = ~Does ye know we encountered a huge beastie on me fishing boat last week?  Survived it, we did.  Helm must be watchin' over us.~
@2094 = ~Ay, now... why are ye looking so crossed-eye at me, hm?~

@2102 = ~Who are you?~
@2103 = ~I am the caravan master here at Cerendor Hold. What do you want?~
@2104 = ~Ah! I've been looking for you. Are you the person who looks after the caravans when they arrive?~
@2105 = ~Where's the caravan that came in with the Red Wizards?~
@2106 = ~And why would you want to know?~
@2107 = ~There is something on that caravan that I am interested in.~
@2108 = ~That caravan is carrying four waggons of Black Lotus and I intend to stop it.~
@2109 = ~Yes, I am. Can I help you?~
@2110 = ~I am trying to find the whereabouts of a caravan that had six Red Wizards travelling with it and has recently arrived from Calimshan.~
@2111 = ~I am looking for a caravan that is guarded by six Red Wizards and is said to be carrying four waggons of Black Lotus.~
@2112 = ~There has been such a caravan through here recently. Why do you want to know about it?~
@2113 = ~I have reason to believe it is carrying a large quantity of Black Lotus on it.~
@2114 = ~Just tell me if it has been through here.~
@2115 = ~I cannot answer that question without a good reason - and the reason has need to be a good one.~
@2116 = ~Be quiet lest you lose your lives! How do I know you are not spies for the Red Wizards?~
@2117 = ~Ah! So it has been here.~
@2118 = ~I did not say that, nor did I hint it. I do not trust you.~
@2119 = ~We have been asked by Elminster to investigate the problems down at Porthpentyrch. While down there, we spoke to a trapped Tanar'ri and learned of this caravan.~
@2120 = ~Does the name Elminster mean anything to you, caravan master? He is my friend and would not be pleased if you were to block my path while I am working for him.~
@2121 = ~Elminster? Porthpentyrch? A tanar'ri? I know Elminster well and I know about the undead that roam Porthpentyrch but I know nothing of the tanar'ri. Very well - come to my room on the first floor where we can talk more freely.~
@2122 = ~We will meet you there.~
@2123 = ~I still do not trust you but I know Elminster and I know him well - do you understand me? For his sake I will talk to you - my room is on the first floor.~
@2124 = ~I trust not you nor your motives. You have a Red Wizard with you.~
@2125 = ~Edwin Odesserion has travelled with us for some time now and even Elminster has placed some small trust in him~
@2126 = ~Eddy's alright. A bit impatient sometimes and prone to muttering to himself, but he's okay otherwise.~
@2127 = ~Odesserion? I've heard that name before now and not in good circumstances!~
@2128 = ~Oh?~
@2129 = ~Have you now? When and where?~
@2130 = ~If you say so. I still don't like Red Wizards and with good reason.~
@2131 = ~What reason is that?~
@2132 = ~Tell me now or regret it at your leisure.~
@2133 = ~Threats don't cut it here. There's worse than your kind have come through here and not left again.~

@2142 = ~What's the problem?~
@2143 = ~What are you afraid of? Shadows?~
@2144 = ~Red Wizards, to be truthful. And their so-called guards.~
@2145 = ~Why? What have they done?~
@2146 = ~Taken over Cerendor Hold is what they've done. Your waggons of Black Lotus came through here yesterday and they weren't the first.~
@2147 = ~Were they not?~
@2148 = ~Ha! Someone's after a very large profit!~
@2149 = ~At the expense of a great deal of misery, yes - a large profit indeed. Do you deal in misery for profit too?~
@2150 = ~Humph! There's profit and there's profit and there's some of it I don't want, at any price.~
@2151 = ~That's the third one to come through in recent weeks, all heavily guarded but that last one was more like a small army. Most of that small army remained here, along with four of the Red Wizards.~
@2152 = ~It quickly became very clear that, unlike their original story, they were not waiting to pick up a returning caravan but were making Cerendor Hold a secure place for themselves.~
@2153 = ~They have not interfered with the normal running of the Hold, nor have they attempted to stop people leaving, but for all intents and purposes, the Hold is now theirs and I have no say in it.~
@2154 = ~Have you tried to do anything about it?~
@2155 = ~Why didn't you just fight them?~
@2156 = ~We're only a small garrison; we'd have been willing to take on the guards but not with four Red Wizards behind them.~
@2157 = ~We could help, if you want?~
@2158 = ~I don't want to fight four Red Wizards either. You're on your own.~
@2159 = ~Done! You will need to get Earl Wultheof's agreement before I can give the word. Come and tell me when you're ready; meanwhile, I'll quietly notify the garrison to be on the alert. Oh - and take this. It's the key to the hold dungeons. My serjeant and some of my men are imprisoned there, guarded of course by the Red Guards. I daresay there will be some down there now.~
@2160 = ~Have you changed your mind?~
@2161 = ~Yes - I'll help you free the garrison.~
@2162 = ~No.~
@2163 = ~Are you ready? Do you have Earl Wultheof's agreement?~
@2164 = ~Yes. Give the word.~
@2165 = ~No, not yet.~
@2166 = ~Good. Come and see me afterwards - and take care.~
@2167 = ~Look what we found hiding in the garderobes! One of my men saw him trying to climb down inside - you'll have to excuse the smell I'm afraid. No doubt you'd like a word with this young man.~
@2168 = ~Many words, as it happens.~
@2169 = ~I think I'll take your word on that - ! So; let's see what this mage has to say for himself.~
@2170 = ~So that's the story is it? We'll be on our guard in future for any caravan that originates from Calimshan and arrives somewhat over-guarded! Listen now: that caravan left here bound for Athkatla and has to cross the old mountain road. If you cut north of the river and head west from here you should catch up with it in the Cloudpeaks somewhere. Good luck - though I doubt you'll need it!~

Listen now: that caravan left here bound for Athkatla and has to cross the old mountain road. If you cut north of the river and head west from here you should catch up with it in the Cloudpeaks somewhere. Before you go, I think the Earl Wultheof would like to talk with you.~
@2172 = ~I think the Wizards of Thay will think twice before trying to set up shop again in Cerendor Hold. It will always be a place of welcome for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2173 = ~You'll need to hurry if you want to catch that caravan.~
@2174 = ~I spoke to the Hold Captain and he says you were responsible for keeping Cerendor together after the takeover.~
@2175 = ~It took all of us, Lady Nalia. The captain does himself no justice saying that.~
@2176 = ~Nevertheless, my mother will reward your loyalty greatly.~
@2177 = ~If she so wishes, but her money would be better sent to the families of those who lost their lives today.~

//Earl Wultheof
@2200 = ~You are?~
@2201 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, Lord Wultheof. I have recently been speaking to the Caravan Master about the small problem you have here in Cerendor Hold.~
@2202 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, Lord Wultheof.~
@2203 = ~Have you? Which small problem amongst all the small problems would that one be?~
@2204 = ~The one concerning your - sudden increase in rodent population and their moving of certain small items out of the Hold?~
@2205 = ~The Black Lotus that's coming through here.~
@2206 = ~Ah. That one. What did he have to say about it?~
@2207 = ~That we needed your permission before he could clean out the rats' nest that has developed in here.~
@2208 = ~And you intend to help him, do you? How do you know that the rats will leave?~
@2209 = ~If they don't leave then they will be treated like all other rats caught in the Hold.~
@2210 = ~Not to put too fine a point on it, I don't expect any of them to find the door in a hurry.~
@2211 = ~Black Lotus? I believe they are trading in Calimshite silk, not Black Lotus.~
@2212 = ~Calimshite silk doesn't come in small, wrapped packages. Nor does it need to be heavily guarded by fifty mercenaries and six Red Wizards.~
@2213 = ~Come to the point.~
@2214 = ~I have been sent on an errand by Elminster and it has now led me here.~
@2215 = ~Elminster, eh? Tell me more.~
@2216 = ~(Tell him about the task so far).~
@2217 = ~So you think you can stop it here?~
@2218 = ~ I do not like the trade; I do not like its effects and I do not like Homen Odesserion carrying it on. In fact, I don't think I like Homen Odesserion either, but he is beyond my reach.~
@2219 = ~If you're sure.... but you wouldn't be here if you weren't sure. Why would you want to do such a thing?~
@2220 = ~For no other reason than that.~
@2221 = ~For money.~
@2222 = ~I am following a task set by Elminster.~
@2223 = ~What then would that be?~
@2224 = ~Well at least we both know where we stand. Go; do this task and I will find some reward for you.~
@2225 = ~I think I am with my Caravan Master on this; with your help we could rid the Hold of these -rats- permanently. Yes, tell him you have my permission to go ahead - and I will join you.~
@2226 = ~Well, you did what you promised; the Hold has been cleaned of its rats. Here is your reward.~
@2227 = ~Well, <CHARNAME> I am too busy now to attend to you. Maybe some other time.~

//Door Guard
@2230 = ~I heard you're going after that Calimshite caravan. Is it true?~
@2231 = ~Yes.~
@2232 = ~What about it? Be quick - my time is short and so is my temper.~
@2233 = ~If you will just mind your temper for a minute, I have some very important information for you - assuming, of course, that you want it?~
@2234 = ~(sigh) What is it?~
@2235 = ~Listen: cross the river when you leave here, then follow it to the cliff and turn west, sticking very closely to the cliff. There's a small path that looks like it goes nowhere but if you follow it up through the Cloudpeaks it will bring you down on to the old Crimmor-Nashkel trade route. That's the way the caravan is going.~
@2236 = ~Are you sure of this?~
@2237 = ~Very sure; I heard that dwarf - Rockfist - discussing it with his tame wizard.~
@2238 = ~Tame wizard? So there is still a Red Wizard with the group? Ha! Thank you for the information, friend!~

//*************************************************************************
//More population - men
@2250 = ~Hey, ain't you the guys that just finished clearing out them undead?  I think one of yer names was <CHARNAME>?  Well, I gotta thank you.  What you done has saved our community.~
@2251 = ~Know what I heard?  I heard that some brave souls came to our village and gave them undead a real big whuppin!  I sure hope it's true!~
@2252 = ~It is true indeed, for it was I, <CHARNAME>, that did it!~
@2253 = ~If it is true, that pretty much solves all your problems, doesn't it?~
@2254 = ~You and everyone else.  I've already met three others that claimed the deed as their own, so you'd best get in line.  As if heroes like that would be such braggarts.  Sheesh.~
@2255 = ~Not by a long shot.  Don't matter if we're now safe when bandits control the roads north and south.  Besides, everyone still thinks Calimshan is behind it all.  If they are, it means war with Calimshan isn't far off, with Tethyr caught in the middle of it all.  No more troubles?  I wish.~
@2256 = ~It's a good day for a change.  The demon's been vanquished and that means back to fishin' for a lot of folks.~
@2257 = ~Good news for all concerned.  Any word on those responsible?~
@2258 = ~Things will be getting back to normal then?~
@2259 = ~You mean the heroes?  Why sure!  <CHARNAME> was the name I heard.  Don't know if it's true or not though.  The story gets bigger with each telling.  By the time I heard it, the heroes were ten feet tall, used treetrunks for clubs and tore the undead apart with their bare hands.~
@2260 = ~Well, it may be better, but we're a long way from normal.  We may be fishing again but it will be a long while before our fish reaches the whole of the region again.  There's a rumour that bandits still hold the roads to the north, so merchants aren't going anywhere, whether they've wares to sell or not.~
@2261 = ~You... you look familiar for some reason.  Kinda like the group that stormed the Naskel mines back awhile.  Leastwise you look like the description my brother Emerson gave.  Ah heck, even if it's not you, I just feel like thanking someone for sorting out the old iron crisis.  Good work down there!~
@2262 = ~Your thanks are welcome, though perhaps a reward might say it better.~
@2263 = ~It was my great pleasure to help you, the common man.  I could not stand by while such villainy as this was allowed to pass!~
@2264 = ~I only did what was necessary.  It could have been anyone.~
@2265 = ~Well you've got some nerve!  Sure you may have helped the Sword Coast, but it's not like everything is wonderful now.  I'll be back to work tomorrow, but it won't matter.  As long as everyone thinks Calimshan was behind the recent problem here, Porthpentyrch could be on the frontline of a war.  You try and sleep at night when such as this is going on!~
@2266 = ~No wonder you went down those mines.  You're a complete loon.  Well, as long as the job is done, I suppose it doesn't matter if your helm is on too tight.  Hey, how about pointing your righteous wrath at the brigands to the south?  You could do something about the Black Lotus trade that's supposed to be coming though here.~
@2267 = ~Nay, it couldn't have been anyone.  People were scared, most still are.  Don't get me wrong, everyone is grateful.  It's just that things aren't going to change much.  Rumors still talk of Calimshite plots and Thayan agents and we won't be able to get our fish out properly.  At least until the trade routes are finally cleared of bandits, anyway.~
@2268 = ~It's back to work soon enough for most of us now.  Good news, but I hear who organized the whole plot is still a mystery.  Until they know for sure, the Council of Six aren't going to let up pressure on Tethyr to let their armies through into Calimshan.~

//More population - women
@2270 = ~Hey, aren't you <CHARNAME>!  You're the one who killed the demon.  You must be real brave to have done what you did.  Wow, real heroes, here in Porthpentyrch.~
@2271 = ~It's wonderful that the men are going to be fishing again.  Glad to get the hubby out of the house, I will be.  He was practically going insane not being able to work.  I suppose now all we have to worry about is... well... bandits hijacking all our merchant caravans.~
@2272 = ~But being able to fish again will surely relieve some of the tensions in the area, won't it?~
@2273 = ~What trouble could some paltry bandits cause?  With the fishing starting again, the village is on its way to recovery!~
@2274 = ~Oh certainly!  It's just that since the bandits attack all merchant caravans, no one dares transport goods unless they have an armed escort from Amn.  They are apparently extra vicious if you are thought to be dealing in - certain - goods.  We can catch fish but no one will dare the roads.~
@2275 = ~Well, everyone would probably relax a bit more if they knew who was behind the plot.  With all the talk of Thayan agents, Zhentish spies and Calimshite politics, nobody knows who to trust anymore.~
@2276 = ~Sorry, but I don't have time for talkin'.  We may be fishing again but my life is no easier.  Bandits raid every caravan we send out of town, so it don't matter if we have fish.  Nobody else is going to be getting any.~
@2277 = ~So you're the high and mighty heroes who saved Porthpentyrch, eh?  Pardon me if I don't jump for joy, but the only thing your efforts got me was a chance to retrieve my husband's body.  I should be grateful for that, I suppose, but I don't feel too much like celebrating right now.~
@2278 = ~Your name wouldn't be <CHARNAME>, by any chance?  You look a bit like the person that supposedly saved our village.~
@2279 = ~That would be me, but I don't really want to make a big fuss about it.~
@2280 = ~Why yes, I am the hero that liberated your livelihood.~
@2281 = ~I was going to thank you, but it sounds like you're doing a fine job congratulating yourselves.  Still, you did a great service to our village.  Once the trouble on the roads is dealt with, the rest of the region will benefit too.~
@2282 = ~You are too modest.  With what you've done, this village is on its way back to normal.  Not that everyone can relax just yet.  Hopefully whoever was behind it all is found soon, before Amn and Calimshan fall into war over it.~
@2283 = ~You're the adventurers that saved the village aren't you?  I should be thankful and all, but I just think there's so much more to be done.  The boats are out fishing but bandits rule the roads south and relations between Amn and Calimshan are still horrible.  Lots to be done yet.~

@2303 = ~Why didn't you stop him?~
@2304 = ~Why would I want to do that?~
@2305 = ~Shar save me from stupid clerics and renegade Harpers!~
@2306 = ~Welcome to this humble place. How can I help you?~
@2307 = ~Who are you?~
@2308 = ~I am Gibri'al Melvarm of Esmeltaram, Cleric of Eldath. You are...?~
@2309 = ~I am known as <CHARNAME>.~
@2310 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn, terror of the Sword Coast and killer of clerics.~
@2311 = ~Indeed. There are many of you - do you have a name that distinguishes you from the others?~
@2312 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, how may I help you? Do you need healing?~
@2313 = ~Do you have an Elven or Half-Elven Harper here by the name of Eildaren Colver?~
@2314 = ~What is this place?~
@2315 = ~Yes.~
@2316 = ~No.~
@2317 = ~This is an Enclave of Eldath, Goddess of the Rivers and Streams.~
@2318 = ~I thought the followers of Eldath shunned the cities? What are you doing here?~
@2319 = ~It is a long tale how I found myself caught here in Athkatla and I will not bore you with it. Suffice to say, while I am here I find peace in healing the sick. I keep here a small Enclave where travellers are brought when they are too far from home to be taken for healing there. Do you need healing, <CHARNAME>?~
@2320 = ~Yes, we do, as it happens. She was brought in yesterday from the Silverale Hall.~
@2321 = ~I need to speak to her.~
@2322 = ~That is not possible. The lady is unconscious with a fever and I am afraid she will die.~
@2323 = ~What??? Where is she?~
@2324 = ~Come with me.~
@2325 = ~As you see, the lady lies here in a high fever.~
@2326 = ~Is there nothing you can do?~
@2327 = ~No. This needs someone far more powerful than I. Someone who really knows what the problem may be - another Harper, for example.~
@2328 = ~Ah. Then I think I know just where that help may be found.~
@2329 = ~Late yesterday afternoon. The lady was already unconscious. See the colour of her face and skin? As yellow as the petals of the Brightstar. I thought at first she had been poisoned but now I am not so sure; in all my years as a Cleric of Eldath I have never seen the skin of anyone go that colour. I am doubtful she will last the next three nights.~
@2330 = ~I must leave this in your hands then; I will tend her as best I can until your return.~
@2331 = ~Let me see... hmm... When was she brought in, good Gibri'al? What was she like? Did she speak?~
@2332 = ~I have seen this but once before and I regret that the victim did not recover. This disease - if disease it be - is beyond me, Gibri'al, <CHARNAME>; we must seek for help elsewhere.~

@2353 = ~You need to talk to Garalial. I will not answer your questions.~
@2354 = ~Have you found the dwarf-king's orb?~
@2355 = ~Not yet.~
@2356 = ~So, are you willing to do what I ask?~
@2357 = ~That depends; I will assess it when you have told me just what it is.~
@2358 = ~I don't seem to have much choice, do I?~
@2359 = ~Well, 30,000 gold pieces was the choice you had. Now you have to decide how badly you want Garalial's help.~
@2360 = ~Get on with it.~
@2361 = ~There is an item in the dwarven halls below Porthpentyrch that I want - it's as simple as that.~
@2362 = ~Lady, I have been in the caves under the village and I assure you that there is no part of it left unexplored.~
@2363 = ~Is it now? What's the catch?~
@2364 = ~I did not say the caves - I said the dwarven halls. There is a hidden door near the cave entrance that a skilled thief can find but it requires a key to unlock it.~
@2365 = ~Ah. And you have the key, no doubt?~
@2366 = ~I do have the key to the dwarf halls but the catch is that I do not know what is beyond the door. I have heard the usual rumours of undead, death knights, traps - nothing you can't handle.~
@2367 = ~So why don't you go and fetch whatever-it-is?~
@2368 = ~I am no thief -~
@2369 = ~And I am?~
@2370 = ~ - and I do not have the skills to get past the obstacles in the dwarf halls. You, on the other hand -~
@2371 = ~Yes?~
@2372 = ~Yes, yes. I can do it. What is it you want?~
@2373 = ~You reputation preceeds you. I much admire the way you got Ceinwen Ravenhair to cooperate; that was a stroke of genius.~
@2374 = ~What is it you want?~
@2375 = ~I want the orb from the dwarf-king's sceptre.~
@2376 = ~You want what?! Just where is that?~
@2377 = ~From all the research I have done it seems that the dwarf-king's tomb is at the far end of the dwarven halls. Everything I have read says that the tomb is heavily protected but no two sources agree on what those protections are or what forms they take. I can warn you but I cannot prepare you.~
@2378 = ~What's so special about this orb?~
@2379 = ~Right. So you're looking for more idiots to get themselves killed?~
@2380 = ~Only if you want to get yourselves killed. I would rather you arrived back here in one piece and with the orb.~
@2381 = ~I don't know and that's why I want it. All the sources I have hint - hint! - at the orb being a source of great magical power. Even Khelben Blackstaff has expressed an interest in it.~
@2382 = ~You know Khelben Blackstaff???~
@2383 = ~No, I do not know the harper, though there are times when I wish I did. I doubt he even knows I exist.~
@2384 = ~If he knows Geltarath here then he probably knows you. Yes, I will take that key and see what I can find.~
@2385 = ~Ha! Well at least he knows *I* exist! Give me the key and let me fetch this orb.~
@2386 = ~Here it is. I suggest you talk to Garalial before you leave to see if he knows any more.~
@2387 = ~If you mean the Orb of Breaca then yes, I have it.~
@2388 = ~Is it this pretty plaything that you mean?~
@2389 = ~It is no 'pretty plaything', oaf. If you wish Garalial's help then pay the price and give me the orb - now.~
@2390 = ~Patience, lady, patience. The contract has changed; Garalial here can release the village first and then I will part with the orb. I mean, how do I know that I can trust a renegade harper?~
@2391 = ~Two things, Bhaalspawn. 1. Orb equals village release. 2. Orb *first* then village release. Do I make myself very clear?~
@2392 = ~Very clear. Be just as clear lady that if your friend here does not release the village, I will come hunting for him and his death will not be quick and it will not be easy.~
@2393 = ~I think I'll keep the orb until the job is done.~
@2394 = ~The door is that way, Bhaalspawn. Come back when you've thought about it.~
@2395 = ~The Orb of Breaca - that is it, indeed. I did not want to mention its name in case I was disappointed again as so many times before. Tell me, was it difficult to obtain?~
@2396 = ~You were right about the traps and the undead, lady - and many other foul things besides. Did you know of the death knights that call themselves the 'Three'?~
@2397 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I did not. What of them?~
@2398 = ~They guard the entrance to the tomb of Meilir of Meilirion. It is unusual to see three death knights together and I had the feeling that they were not altogether what they seemed. Still, they let us pass eventually.~
@2399 = ~They guarded the entrance to the tomb of Meilir of Meilirion. It is unusual to see three death knights together and I had the feeling that they were not altogether what they seemed. When they attacked, for some long moments I thought we were dead. I have never seen or heard of death knights using magic before.~
@2400 = ~Nor have I, <CHARNAME>. They are destroyed?~
@2401 = ~Yes. We barely survived.~
@2402 = ~What of the occupant of the tomb? Who was he? Meilir of Meilirion, you said?~
@2403 = ~I think you will find him in the history scrolls of the Vilhon Reach. He told us a remarkable story of 'luck and stupidity' as he called it. Stupidity may have trapped him but his luck finally held - his spirit is now at peace.~
@2404 = ~I think you will find him in the history scrolls of the Vilhon Reach. He chose to fight us at the last, something which I did not really want. I do not know even now if his spirit is truly at rest.~
@2405 = ~What of the Orb?~
@2406 = ~He said it came from the lair of a green dragon in the Giant's Run Mountains. Where it was before that, only the gods know. The halls below Porthpentyrch, Lady Angharad? They had a name once - he called them 'Meldorarth'.~
@2407 = ~I found it lying on his tomb - not part of his sword at all.~
@2408 = ~'Meldorarth'? Yes, I remember Garalial using that name when speaking of his encounter with the dwarf-lord many years ago. Only he did not know how close he was to the Orb - sometimes his tongue is far to quick for his comfort.  Very well, <CHARNAME>, you have fulfilled your side of the contract. Now it is with us to fill ours. Please talk to Garalial - he will tell you what we need to do next.~
@2409 = ~Just lying there, eh? Very well, <CHARNAME>, you have fulfilled your side of the contract. Now it is with us to fill ours. Please talk to Garalial - he will tell you what we need to do next.~
@2410 = ~Thought about it, have you?~
@2411 = ~Yes. Take the orb and remember what I said. I *will* find you both.~
@2412 = ~No.~

@2525 = ~Ah! You're the sweet maiden from the circus! I saw you there before it all went horribly wrong.~
@2526 = ~It is very kind of you to say so, my sweet dove!~
@2527 = ~Boo is no rat! Boo is a Minature Giant Space Hamster, aren't you, Boo? See how his whiskers twitch - you have offended him, lady!~
@2528 = ~It is kind of you to call me that, lady, but I am no maiden; I am an Avariel from Faenya-Dale.~
@2530 = ~Well, I know you probably mean no harm but this is *my* house.~
@2531 = ~Strangers wandering in without invitation, huh? Well, you're not welcome here!~
@2532 = ~If ye mean no harm then make yourselves at home.~
@2533 = ~I could do with a draft of strong Dwarven Ale. You don't happen to have any on you, do you?~
@2534 = ~Druids! You don't often see you folk in town!~
@2535 = ~Ah - I don't hold with Red Wizards. There's nothing here for you.~
@2536 = ~Weak fool! I wouldn't be seen dead staying in such a hovel as this!~
@2537 = ~There are worse places in Amn than Athkatla but not many.~
@2538 = ~I am here under protest. I do not like the city and would prefer not to be here.~

//Lughaidh
@2550 = ~Who're you?~
@2551 = ~Ah, Lughaidh. I believe you know something of a small trinket belonging to the Lady Elizabeth Pavaral?~
@2552 = ~So where'd you get my name from then?~
@2553 = ~No names, no packdrill.~
@2554 = ~Oengus of Caer Callidyrr. He was kind enough to point you out.~
@2555 = ~Oh, right. What's it got to do with you anyway?~
@2556 = ~The lady would like it back.~
@2557 = ~I guess if Oengus says I've got it, he should know. What of it?~
@2558 = ~It was a gift from her deceased father. She says you can keep all else you took - she just wants the ring back.~
@2559 = ~Well, as it's not worth a lot, I guess she can have it.~
@2561 = ~Tough. I've given it to my girl.~
@2562 = ~I'll buy it from you. How much do you want for it?~
@2563 = ~What part of 'you can't have it' don't you understand?? Boys - I think this idiot needs a lesson in courtesy!~

//*************************************************************************
//Oengus of Caer Callidyrr
@2600 = ~Yes? How may I help you, <CHARNAME>?~
@2601 = ~Who are you?~
@2602 = ~I am Oengus of Caer Callidyrr, one of Renal Bloodscalp's lieutenants. You may speak to me as freely as if I were Renal himself.~
@2603 = ~Ha! Another Moonshae Islander!~
@2604 = ~That does not concern you. State your business or begone.~
@2605 = ~I think you are aware that there is an emissary from Waterdeep staying at the Silverale Hall?~
@2606 = ~There is very little that escapes the notice of Renal Bloodscalp in this city. What of her? - the Lady Elizabeth Pavaral I believe is her name?~
@2607 = ~When she first arrived in Athkatla she took a wrong turn into the Slums and was immediately robbed.~
@2608 = ~That is not too surprising, is it? The Slums is not a good place to get lost in.~
@2609 = ~She gave a good description of a group of Shadow Thieves disappearing into the sewers. Don't worry - she told the Town Guard who have done precisely nothing. As usual.~
@2610 = ~Ah. The Town Guard is not part of my worries. What is it that Lady Elizabeth is so desperate to get back? Is it that valuable? And why did she ask you?~
@2611 = ~She recognised me from an incident a long time ago in Baldur's Gate. It is a ring given to her by her father which she says is not valuable. A flamedance set with a garnet.~
@2612 = ~Yes. Yes, I know the ring and I agree that it is not at all valuable. Very well; if my ears do not deceive me you will find that Lughaidh and his group have just arrived in. You will need to persuade them to part with this ring - you have my permission to do so. If you wish to see Renal Bloodscalp, I believe he is now free.~
@2613 = ~Did you get your ring back from Lughaidh?~
@2614 = ~Not yet.~
@2615 = ~Yes. It got a bit... messy; unfortunately Lughaidh is no longer with you.~
@2616 = ~Yes. He was happy to hand it over when he realised it was valueless.~
@2617 = ~Pity. He was a promising young thief, if a little rash at times.~
@2618 = ~Ah, good. I like a story that ends happily.~

@2668 = ~Nothing.~
@2669 = ~Nothin', is it? I think you were stealing! Guards! Guards!~
@2670 = ~Shelter, is it? You were told to keep out of the caravans. You will answer to Mordaran Rockfist for this.~
@2671 = ~Ooops....~

@2709 = ~What!? Explain yourself!~
@2710 = ~Ah! So the news hasn't got here yet. Perhaps we'd better tell this Mordaran Rockfist too..?~
@2711 = ~Perhaps you had better tell me first. I will decide if Rockfist needs to know.~
@2712 = ~We were inside Cerendor Hold when it was attacked by a tribe of hillmen.~
@2713 = ~Hillmen? In the Cloudpeak Mountains? Bah! I've heard children with better tales than that. I have nothing further to say to you.~

@2732 = ~There's been trouble down south in Calimshan. The last caravan that came through reported fighting in the port.~
@2733 = ~Not much to tell, I'm afraid. Imradim is a bit remote and all our news comes from the caravans that pass through.~

@2751 = ~What's this about Cerendor Hold? The wizard here says you've just come from there.~
@2752 = ~We have. A large bunch of hillmen got in and created havok.~
@2753 = ~And you escaped. How?~
@2754 = ~Actually, no, we didn't. We were inside Cerendor Hold when they attacked. The drawbridge was quickly pulled up but the guards missed the party that came over the wall where it meets the cliff face next to the river. You should have cut those trees down, you know.~
@2755 = ~Go on. Joined with my men did you?~
@2756 = ~Again, no. We didn't like the look of them and couldn't care less about them. The hillmen didn't care who they attacked and we were trapped with our backs to the wall in Cerendor's Tomb. Three of your men took the hillmen from the rear and saved us.~
@2757 = ~Huh. Then what happened?~
@2758 = ~Either the hillmen got what they came for or the defence was too much, because they dropped the drawbridge and disappeared as quickly as they came.~
@2759 = ~And my men?~
@2760 = ~Seven dead and twenty three wounded, eight badly. Because they had saved us in that fight, I agreed to bring you this message. I consider that my obligation is now discharged.~
@2761 = ~Hrr. The obligation is accepted, <PRO_RACE>. Where are you going?~
@2762 = ~Athkatla.~
@2763 = ~Baldur's Gate.~
@2764 = ~Keep out of the waggons and you can stay under our protection for the journey.~
@2765 = ~We accept.~
@2766 = ~We'll stay for the night and go on in the morning. The waggons will move too slowly for us.~

@2773 = ~Seeing that you put it like that; I am <CHARNAME> and you, I take it, are Mordaran Rockfist?~
@2774 = ~So? Whaddya want?~
@2775 = ~I have information that you're carrying a very large load of Black Lotus bound for Athkatla and Baldur's Gate.~
@2776 = ~We've just come from Cerendor Hold. I overheard the Red Guards there saying that this caravan was heading for Athkatla and Baldur's Gate; we were hoping that we could find protection as far as Nashkel.~
@2777 = ~Oh yeh? Red Company! I want this lot dead inside the next two minutes!!!!~
@2778 = ~Do you now? Talk fast or die slow - where did you learn that?~
@2779 = ~A Red Wizard by the name of Ailoth Tam.~
@2780 = ~Squealed like a stuck pig did he? In over his head, that one. What were you doing in Cerendor Hold? And how did you get the information from him?~
@2781 = ~We were waiting for transport downriver when the hold was attacked by a large force of bandits and hillmen.~
@2782 = ~Again, no. We didn't like the look of them and couldn't care less about them. The raiders didn't care who they attacked and we were trapped with our backs to the wall in Cerendor's Tomb. Three of your men took the hillmen from the rear and saved us.~
@2783 = ~Either the raiders got what they came for or the defence was too much, because they dropped the drawbridge and disappeared as quickly as they came.~
@2784 = ~Seven dead and twenty three wounded, eight badly. Because they had saved us in that fight, I agreed to bring you this message.~
@2785 = ~That many? Talos' teeth! Megred; take twelve men and head back for Cerendor Hold. See what you can do to sort out the mess there.~
@2786 = ~Just do it. You. What do you want out of this?~
@2787 = ~Money. You're going to be short of men with the contingent going back to Cerendor and we can look after ourselves.~

@2791 = ~It'll cost ya. I don't take passengers.~
@2792 = ~How much?~
@2793 = ~We can earn our keep. You look like you need a few more men.~
@2794 = ~I told ya - I don't take passengers. Ya got two minutes to get out of this camp and don't bother to return. We kill first and ask questions later.~
@2795 = ~You got ears that flap too much for your own safety. How do y' know I need more men? Give me one good reason not to kill you here and now.~
@2796 = ~There's a tribe of hillmen on their way across the Cloudpeak Mountains. They attacked Cerendor Hold but were beaten off; we were there at the time. You're going to need all the help you can get.~
@2797 = ~Huh. So you say. A whole tribe?~
@2798 = ~It looked that way. Maybe two working together.~
@2799 = ~Money. You're going to be short of men with the contingent going back to Cerendor and as I told you, we can look after ourselves.~
@2800 = ~Huh. Right. You get the same pay and conditions as the rest of them and number one condition is Keep Out Of The Waggons. You get that?~
@2801 = ~Huh. My thought is you can't count. Are ye sure ye can fight?~
@2802 = ~Ask the men in Cerendor Hold.~
@2803 = ~I guess I'll have my answer soon enough. You get the same pay and conditions as the rest of them and number one condition is Keep Out Of The Waggons. You get that?~

Occasionally a Calimshite merchantman comes through here but not often. They don't make good ships in Calimshan.~
@3007 = ~Why not?~

@3218 = ~Then leave this place while you still may.~
@3219 = ~Courage may sometimes be its own reward. You may pass but do not forget that we will be here on your way back. Leave all as you find it or pay the price.~
@3220 = ~Do not say you were not warned when you go screaming to the feet of the poor god you worship.~
@3221 = ~Curious.... you have returned, despite my previous warning. This will be your last; what is it you want?~
@3222 = ~I've changed my mind. I don't want to leave.~
@3223 = ~I still want to look upon the tomb of the dwarf-lord who lies here.~
@3224 = ~No, mortal. That I cannot permit. Do not say I was not fair when you go screaming to the feet of the poor god you worship.~

@3250 = ~So.... you killed the foul undead that have taken residence in these halls, defeated the many traps I set and finally got past my guardians.... I'm impressed.~
@3251 = ~It wasn't that difficult.~
@3252 = ~Some guardians. They didn't do too well guarding you.~
@3253 = ~*Your* guardians? Who are you?~
@3254 = ~Ha! So say you. I was watching, young Bhaalspawn and you still have to find your way out. No, don't bother yet - the door is locked behind you.~
@3255 = ~Who are you to lock me in thus? I demand to be released now!~
@3256 = ~Your release depends on your behaviour and the answers to my questions, Bhaalspawn. Now, which one are you?~
@3257 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@3258 = ~You're the one who has been making all the noise along the Sword Coast, aren't you? Yes, I may be dead but that doesn't mean I'm deaf. What have you been sent here for? Or have you simply decided to do a bit of freelance tomb-raiding? All those skeletons that you waded through to get here - they decided that a bit of freelance tomb-raiding was a good way to get rich quick. Would you like to join them?~
@3259 = ~All in my own good time - maybe. What else do you have to offer?~
@3260 = ~Strong words, dwarf. Can you back them up?~
@3261 = ~Shall we see?~
@3262 = ~Nothing. Death is all I have to offer - or life, if I am feeling generous.~
@3263 = ~What about the orb?~
@3264 = ~Ah! So we finally get to it - you want the Orb of Breaca.~
@3265 = ~Yes. Where is it?~
@3266 = ~No dwarf - *I* do not want the orb - I have been sent to get it.~
@3267 = ~I'm not sure that telling you is such a good idea. No, on seconds thoughts, it is not. I would not release such power to one such as you. You may leave.~
@3268 = ~*Sent* to get it? By whom? And why?~
@3269 = ~You do not need to know that. Just give me the orb and I'll be gone.~
@3270 = ~Have you heard of Angharad Firehair? No, I didn't think so. How about Garalial Geltareth?~
@3271 = ~I'm not sure that just giving it to you is such a good idea. No, on seconds thoughts, it is not. I would not release such power to one such as you. You may leave.~
@3272 = ~Geltarath the renegade Harper? Yes, I know him. He spent some time here once - we parted on unfriendly terms and he knows better than to return. Who is this Angharad Firehair?~
@3273 = ~His lady. It is she that wants the orb.~
@3274 = ~What for?~
@3275 = ~To help free the village of Porthpentyrch from its undead inhabitants.~
@3276 = ~No, your reason is not good enough. I will keep the orb. I would not release such power to one such as you. You may leave.~
@3277 = ~You wish to reverse the stupidity of that Thayan wizard? No, it sounds too good to be true coming from one with your reputation. I will keep the orb. I would not release such power to one such as you. You may leave.~
@3278 = ~You wish to reverse the stupidity of that Thayan wizard? And what does this Angharad Firehair want with the Orb, I wonder? Yet... I am tired of playing games with each new band of adventures who seek riches only for themselves; now here you come, presenting me with the only good reason I have heard of to part with the Orb and a reputation that suggests you may be telling the truth.~
@3279 = ~Here - take the key to my tomb and be done with it.~
@3280 = ~Your reputation is not the best, is it <CHARNAME>? And you tell me you want to reverse the stupidity of that Thayan wizard? Despite your outward arrogance you can do good when the need arises. I should think about this.... yet I am tired of playing games with each new band of adventures who seek riches only for themselves and here you come, presenting me with the only good reason I have heard of to part with the Orb.~
@3281 = ~I am - I was - Meilir of Meilirion, a dwarfhome under the Deepwing Mountains.~
@3282 = ~Then you are a long way from home, ghost.~
@3283 = ~I am.... a long way from home....a very long way from home. And a very long time away from home.....~
@3284 = ~What brought you to be buried here? The Deepwing Mountains must be a hundred or more leagues from here.~
@3285 = ~Are you the guardian of a magic orb?~
@3286 = ~Closer to two hundred leagues, young adventurer. Would you tell an old dwarven spirit your name?~
@3287 = ~I don't have the time for this. I have come seeking a magic orb - do you know of its whereabouts?~
@3288 = ~Ah! - you're the one who has been making all the noise along the Sword Coast, aren't you? Yes, I may be dead but it doesn't mean I'm deaf. What have you been sent here for? Or have you simply decided to do a bit of freelance tomb-raiding? All those skeletons and ghasts that you waded through to get here - they decided that a bit of freelance tomb-raiding was a good way to get rich quick. Would you like to join them?~
@3289 = ~I would rather not. What else do you have to offer?~
@3290 = ~*chuckle* A good answer, <CHARNAME>. What else do I have to offer? A tale of luck and stupidity, if you'd care to hear it.~
@3291 = ~I think I have the time for it.~
@3292 = ~How long will it take to tell?~
@3293 = ~As long as it takes and no longer. Shall I begin?~
@3294 = ~I was one of the richest dwarves on the Vilhon Reach and I came by my gold honestly, if, shall we say, a little unusually. I was prospecting an old dwarf mine for the possibility of a new vein of mithril ore - or if not a new one, one that was worth digging - when my pickhammer made an odd, hollow, sound against one wall. Now, I'd known that mine for years but I didn't remember any stories about hollow places and I knew this particular mineshaft like it was the back of my own hand.~
@3295 = ~Go on.~
@3296 = ~I chipped gently at that rock face and opened up a hole just large enough to crawl through. I didn't quite trust the rock yet, you see. I wriggled through the hole into a huge chamber, stood up, held up my torch and looked straight into the eye of a dragon. We had all heard the rumours and stories of the dragon lairs that are supposed to exist in the Deepwing Mountains but I had actually found one. I nearly died on the spot.~
@3297 = ~Oh, the dragon - an azure - was long dead but that isn't your first thought when you see one. It was quite some time before I ventured back though the hole and into the dragon's lair again. I was made - rich beyond any dreams I could have ever had.~
@3298 = ~And?~
@3299 = ~I lived it. I travelled the Vilhon Reach in luxury and comfort and set up home in Hlondeth. Once a dwarf, always a dwarf - at the start I couldn't bear to be too far from the Deepwing Mountains and caves, you see. But gradually, the more I saw of the Vilhon Reach, the more I was bitten by the wanderlust and eventually it took me from the Deepwing Mountains to Ormath and the Deepwash, over the Snowflake Mountains and into Riatavin. I never stayed long in one place; there was always too much to see and I had the money to see it.~
@3300 = ~At Riatavin I fell in with a caravan that was heading for Saradush, Castle Tethyr, the Trade Way, Athkatla and on to places north. There's only so much gold you can carry with you and by now I was getting a little short of it, so I joined as a caravan guard. A dwarf and his axe are rarely parted; it was the one item I would not part with. It had been one of the first things I had purchased with the dragon's gold and had been forged by the finest dwarven smith on the Reach. I waited a year for him to create that axe.~
@3301 = ~What happened after you joined the caravan?~
@3302 = ~We got as far as Castle Tethyr when we met a caravan coming up from Calimshan. There were dwarfs in that caravan - slaves, chained and bound - and I saw red. Luck was still with me that day because all of the Calimshite guards, save three, lay dead befoe they realised what had hit them. We took the caravan and headed west for Zazesspur where we sold the Calimshite goods - the Githyanki merchants will buy anything if they think they're getting a bargain! - and charted a Amnish ship to take us to Murann, where the freed slaves intended to join a dwarf clan there.~
@3303 = ~By now I was ready to go home, but on the third day out we were hit by a tremendous storm and were driven ashore near Porthpentyrch.~
@3304 = ~Ah. So that's how you got here. What about the dragon's hoard back in Hlondeth?~
@3305 = ~It eventually arrived in Porthpentyrch many months later - under very heavy guard - but that is not yet part of this story. There were caves under the mountain that we found very useful indeed and we set about enlarging and building to turn them into a home fit for dwarfkind. There was no human village here then and the halls of Meldorarth both expanded and filled as more dwarfs heard of it, came to see it, then stayed.~
@3306 = ~Then one day a wandering bard turned up in the halls of Meldorarth and told a tale of a wonderous treasure stolen by a green dragon, now supposed long dead, somewhere up in the Giant's Run. Of course I fell for it and not many weeks later, marched out with a large company to find and retrieve that treasure.~
@3307 = ~You fell for it?~
@3308 = ~This is going on far too long and I don't have the time for this. I have come seeking a magic orb - do you know of its whereabouts?~
@3309 = ~I have more than a large suspicion that a Charm spell - or spells - were involved. He was no bard, though we did not know that then. Eventually we arrived at the Giant's Run but not without a fair set of misadventures along the way. I doubt that it is much of a surprise to you that we also found the dragon's lair quite easily, but the dragon was far from dead - just far from home - but not far enough away for us. The day we arrived, she chose to come home.~
@3310 = ~In the fight that followed the dragon ripped up almost all of the company before she decided that those that remained would get her before she got them. She abandoned the fight to nurse her injuries and we nursed ours; we raided the dragon horde and brought away almost all of it but it was a bitter price we had paid. Suddenly Hlondeth and the Deepwing Mountains didn't seem like home anymore, so we hired a caravan and guards and made our way back to Meldorarth.~
@3311 = ~What of the bard?~
@3312 = ~How did you die? What happened to the treasure?~
@3313 = ~All in good time. We had not been back in Meldorarth long when the bard turned up again. Somehow, I thought that he would and had posted a watch for him. He was brought into the high hall and then we had the truth from him; he wanted us to get the treasure for him and in particular, he wanted a large blue-red diamond called the Orb of Breaca.~
@3314 = ~Ahhhh.~
@3315 = ~Ha! So you have the orb. I have come looking for it.~
@3316 = ~He was a necromancer - I no longer remember his name - and the Orb was enchanted with some power that he wanted to make use of. I refused him and had him thrown down into the pits; the memory of my lost bretheren was still heavy in me and I wanted vengeance. Two days later I had him hung by the arms from the cliffs over the harbour and there I left him to die, slowly.~
@3317 = ~I had not reckoned with his power, thinking that he was of little consequence, hung as he was for the crows to pick, but he cursed me to a wasting disease and a lingering non-death in this world. I took a long time to die - many years - losing first my eyesight, then my hearing, then a paralysis took me - all the time my mind was still active and whole.~
@3318 = ~I thought - I hoped - I would go mad, trapped in my own skull beating blindly against its walls but his curse was too good for that, keeping me sane while my body fell slowly to pieces like the dropping of the leaves in the fall. My companions had many years to design and build my tomb - one of the finest ever created by dwarfkind on the Sword Coast! - but I was not aware of this. Finally, even his curse could no longer keep alive my heart and I died, to rise again as a lost spirit, trapped forever in this place.~
@3319 = ~But all curses have a weakness, don't they? Could it not be reversed or lifted?~
@3320 = ~There must have been someone who could have stopped this necromancer's curse?~
@3321 = ~Do you think I did not try, <CHARNAME>! I was doubly rich and I sent all over Faerun for help; between the charlatans and the quacks and the clerics and the mages and the prophets and the druids they achieved precisely nothing!! I rotted and I died.~
@3322 = ~But all curses have a weakness, don't they?~
@3323 = ~This necromancer had a long time to think about it; my only compensation is that he took an equally long time to die. He hung there for almost a month before succumbing to hunger and thirst and he struggled - how he struggled! - to escape. I thought he would bring the cliff down in his efforts. But yes, the curse can be lifted and I can die in peace. I must give the Orb to the Risen Undead - if I could ever know or find one such!~
@3324 = ~I have been undead... and I rose again from that state back to this world.~
@3325 = ~Just give me the Orb - I have need of it.~
@3326 = ~You - ! But - you! But - how?~
@3327 = ~You must have known of the Traps of the Living in the caves not far from here. Someone of the dwarven folk must have put them in; the only way to cross them is to be not living but not dead - I crossed the Traps with the aid of an ex-necromancer and it is not an experience I wish to repeat.~
@3328 = ~You - you crossed the Traps? If I had a voice, I would laugh - *I* designed those traps to protect the graves of my kinfolk and the necromancer must have known this. Oh, but he was a clever one; I can almost admire him for the twist in his curse. Then the Orb of Breaca is yours by right - and finally, *finally* - I can rest in peace!!! Here, take the key to my tomb and may whatever god you worship bless you and keep you forever!!!~
@3329 = ~Ah! To the point so soon. You are looking for the Orb of Breaca? Why?~
@3330 = ~I have been sent here to get it.~
@3331 = ~Have you heard of Angharad Firehair? Or Garalial Geltareth?~
@3332 = ~I'm not sure that just giving it to you is such a good idea. No, on seconds thoughts, it is not. I would not release such power to one such as you. You may leave; your return will not be welcome.~
@3333 = ~Geltareth the renegade Harper? Yes, I know him. He spent some time here once - we parted on unfriendly terms and he knows better than to return. Who is this Angharad Firehair?~
@3334 = ~His lady. It is she who wants the orb.~
@3335 = ~You were warned that your presence here would not be welcomed a second time.~

@3404 = ~Not a friend, no, but I am here to help him.~
@3405 = ~Well, someone here really doesn't like him!~
@3406 = ~Jaheira, *be quiet* and make use of some of that much-vaunted balance that you talk about!! I am not a friend, no, but I am here to help him. ~
@3407 = ~Suit yourself, but I would point out that you are equally strangers to me.~
@3408 = ~Let it remain that way. I am here because the ex-Harper begged for my help.~
@3409 = ~Ah. What form does that help take?~
@3410 = ~He asks that you would lend us the Glass Dagger.~
@3411 = ~The Glass Dagger! What do you need that for?~
@3412 = ~To cut the root of the Tiger's Eye.~
@3413 = ~The Tiger's Eye grows only in the Calim Desert. He must be desperate indeed to have someone go down there.~
@3414 = ~It is his sister, Eildaren, who is sick.~
@3415 = ~Eildaren is sick! Why did you not say so before? Of course you may have the dagger.~
@3416 = ~Thank you. One question though?~
@3417 = ~What is it?~
@3418 = ~Who is Eildaren Colver to you?~
@3419 = ~Eildaren is a friend - a close friend. I have known her since we made mudpies in the gutter and scraped elbows and knees falling out of trees. She is also a healer almost as good as her brother; indeed the very name that she uses - Colver - is a very old word meaning 'healer to all'. Does that answer your question?~
@3420 = ~It does, thank you.~
@3421 = ~He wants the Glass Dagger.~
@3422 = ~There is only one thing that the Glass Dagger is good for and that is cutting the root of the Tiger's Eye in the Calim Desert. Who is sick?~
@3423 = ~Some female half-elf called Eildaren Colver.~
@3424 = ~Eildaren Colver is not 'some female half-elf'! She is Garalial's sister as I guess you well know! Very well; I will loan you the dagger. Just return it to Garalial when you have finished with it - *I* do not wish to see you again.~

@3541 = ~And how do I do that with no information, pray tell?~
@3542 = ~You will do it because you need my help.~
@3543 = ~I've just paid you 30,000 gold pieces for that help!!!!!~
@3544 = ~Try the Silverale Hall. I'm told she has a preference for the place when she's in Athkatla.~
@3545 = ~Well? Are you going to do it? Are you going to help my Angharad?~
@3546 = ~You may have your price. I do not want to get involved in that.~

@3552 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>; you have no idea how long Angharad has been looking for the Orb. And... I admit that I am not fond of recalling my ignominious retreat from Meldorarth. Now, one thing more before we can leave for Porthpentyrch: find me the whereabouts of Eildaren Colvor. I need to talk to her.~
@3553 = ~Have you any idea where she might be?~
@3554 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, you've really managed to upset Angharad haven't you? Under other circumstances that would not be a very good idea at all but... well. One thing more before we can leave for Porthpentyrch: find me the whereabouts of Eildaren Colvor. I need to talk to her.~
@3555 = ~Have you *any* idea where she might be?~
@3556 = ~I need time to get things together for the trip to Porthpentyrch.~
@3557 = ~Well? Have you found Eildaren?~
@3558 = ~Not yet.~
@3559 = ~Yes.~

@3562 = ~WHAT?? Since when?~
@3563 = ~I don't know. Gibri'al does not think she will last another three nights.~
@3564 = ~Go. Do what you need but meet me at the Enclave as soon as possible.~
@3565 = ~Very well.~
@3566 = ~Not so fast, Geltarath. I have paid for your help in good red gold; I want results for that payment.~
@3567 = ~Not so fast, Geltarath. I have paid for your help in blood and sweat to return that geegaw that your 'friend' here wanted; I want my return for that payment.~
@3568 = ~And you *will* get your payment, Bhaalspawn. I have my sister to attend to first; then and only then will I travel to Porthpentyrch. One week, Bhaalspawn, one week and I will see you in the village. Do *not* attempt to get there before that week is up because if you do, you are likely to disturb the counter-curse. Do I make myself clear?~

@3573 = ~Your help. I did not idly ask you to find Eildaren; I need her help in lifting the curse at Porthpentyrch.~
@3574 = ~You have already cost me 30,000 gold pieces and now you expect me to pay more?~
@3575 = ~You have already cost me wounds enough on a chase through Porthpentyrch. Why should I pay further?~
@3576 = ~The money was to buy spell items and equipment to lift the curse in Porthpentyrch but yes, some of it was for my profit. That part I will return to you if we can heal my sister here.~
@3577 = ~Eildaren Colver is your sister?!~
@3578 = ~The Orb was payment for the money that I need to spend in spell items and equipment to lift the curse in Porthpentyrch. I am willing to pay for your help to return my sister to health.~
@3579 = ~Is it so strange that I have a sister? I have two sisters - Eildaren here is the eldest. Ceinwen Ravenhair is the younger.~
@3580 = ~Cei - ! Then you must have known about the problem with Porthpentyrch all along and you gave us no hint of this! What game are you playing, Geltarath?~
@3581 = ~It is no game, <CHARNAME>. Ceinwen and I do not - communicate - if she can help it. There was the matter of a falling out over my leaving the Harpers some years ago. It was then she left the name of Geltarath behind. Jaheira here knew of this.~
@3582 = ~As self-righteous as ever, Jaheira - and just as quick to stick the knife in. Some things never change. But my past family history will not help Eildaren here and now.~
@3583 = ~Ceinwen was imprisoned in Spellhold and rescued by Elminster. I did not tell you that when we last spoke.~
@3584 = ~Yet you knew that Ceinwen Ravenhair had helped us, because I told you so.~
@3585 = ~So what is it you need?~
@3586 = ~It is no game, <CHARNAME>. Ceinwen and I do not - communicate - if she can help it. There was the matter of a falling out over my leaving the Harpers some years ago. It was then she left the name of Geltarath behind. But my past family history will not help Eildaren here and now.~
@3587 = ~As I said, Ceinwen and I hardly speak; moreover, it was irrelevant to the work she did for you as to whether she was my sister or not. Why should I have mentioned it?~
@3588 = ~Why indeed, when put like that. What caused the rift between you?~
@3589 = ~Ceinwen has been held in Spellhold? When? How long ago? Elminster rescued her? You pile pain on my misery, <CHARNAME>!~
@3590 = ~Not long, as I understand it. A matter of a few days only.~
@3591 = ~A few days in that place can seem like a lifetime anywhere else! Was she hurt?~
@3592 = ~I don't believe so. The Cowled Wizards are too busy rebuilding the place to pay too much attention to the inmates at the moment. You would be better asking her yourself though.~
@3593 = ~I would, if I could - and I wish deeply that I could.~
@3594 = ~What caused the rift between you?~
@3595 = ~Peace, Jaheira, peace. Some other time, <CHARNAME>. Right now it is Eildaren that needs my help and not Ceinwen.~
@3596 = ~Some other time, <CHARNAME>. Right now it is Eildaren that needs my help and not Ceinwen.~
@3597 = ~Is it so strange that I have a sister? I have two sisters - Eildaren here is the eldest; the other we do not speak of.~
@3598 = ~I need two things. One is easy to get - I hope - and the other, not so easy.~
@3599 = ~Ah. Let us ignore the 'easy' for now and talk about the 'not so easy'. Who or what is guarding it?~
@3600 = ~Just spit it out, Geltareth. What do I have to fight this time?~
@3601 = ~I am not aware of any guardian in this case. It is a plant, but it only grows on the northern edge of the Calim Desert, south of Memnon and at a place called Imradim.~
@3602 = ~The Calim Desert. Right. A trip of at least one month - can Eildaren last that long? Gibri'al said that she would not last above three days.~
@3603 = ~If you value your life, young wizard - Edwin Odesserion, if I recall? - you will not go anywhere near the Pasha Baadilhaela. Your life expectancy would be less than the spider you just put your foot on.~
@3604 = ~The Calim Desert is a trip of at least one month - can Eildaren last that long? Gibri'al said that she would not last above three days.~
@3605 = ~I can keep Eildaren alive but I cannot cure her without an extract made from the plant. As for the trip; I can send you there and I have a portable portal that will bring you home. Unfortunately it will only work once, so you must be finished in Imradim before you activate it.~
@3606 = ~What is this plant called?~
@3607 = ~The Tiger's Eye. It is so named because of the markings on the flowers.~
@3608 = ~And it can only be found in the Calim Desert?~
@3609 = ~I am hiding nothing, Sir Knight!!! My sister's life is at stake here - is that good enough reason for you? Or has the entire conversation failed to penetrate that thick skull of yours because you've taken one too many blows to the head? Listen closely and maybe you'll remember this at least - the plant is called the Tiger's Eye. It is so named because of the markings on the flowers.~
@3610 = ~It is native to that area. Strangely, it is said to grow only in one cave in the area.~
@3611 = ~What is the other thing you require?~
@3612 = ~Wait one moment. What is it, Jan?~
@3613 = ~There may be more sun than you would want, Jan Jansen - and no turnip soup to go with it.~
@3614 = ~Turnips don't grow in the desert, Jan. It's too hot for them.~
@3615 = ~(laughs)~
@3616 = ~Be quiet for a minute, Jan. What is the other thing you require, Geltarath?~
@3617 = ~Go to Tigernach mic Muirgheas and ask him for the loan of the Glass Dagger. You will need it to cut the Tiger's Eye, for to use metal on the stalk will destroy the plant. Tigernach lives in the big house in the centre of the westside. Return here when you have the dagger.~
@3618 = ~Do you have the dagger yet?~
@3619 = ~Good. Are you ready to depart for Imradim?~
@3620 = ~Well? Do you have the flower? Did you find it?~
@3621 = ~Yes - here it is. You were right - it was at the back of the cave above the town. There are two pools in there that glow with a strange green light and the Tiger's Eye grows next to them.~
@3622 = ~No. I changed my mind and left it behind.~
@3623 = ~Then may you be damned in all the Nine Hells from here to eternity!! Out and be gone with you - I have nothing more to say to one so mean-sprited as you! I do not understand how Jaheira can even bear to be with you! Out!! Out and be gone!! Let me grieve for my sister without you gloating and smirking in my shadow. Out, I say - OUT!! OUT!!!~
@3624 = ~Oh, slow down old man! I was only playing a joke - look, here it is.~
@3625 = ~Then may you be damned in all the Nine Hells from here to eternity!! Out and be gone with you - I have nothing more to say to one so mean-sprited as you! Out!! Out and be gone!! Let me grieve for my sister without you gloating and smirking in my shadow. Out, I say - OUT!! OUT!!!~
@3626 = ~You are not a nice person, are you, Bhaalspawn? Joking with the lives of others? And Jaheira here thinks that I am unpleasant! ~
@3627 = ~You are not a nice person, are you, Bhaalspawn? Joking with the lives of others?~
@3628 = ~Ah, have the plant and be done with you. Just hurry it up and get down to Porthpentyrch.~
@3629 = ~No, you are not a nice person at all. Fortunately for you a promise given is a promise held. Now get the hells out of here and return tomorrow - by then Eildaren will be well or she will be dead and if she is dead, you will wait upon me until *I* am ready to go to Porthpentyrch. Understand me? Now get out!!~
@3630 = ~May Mystra bless you, <CHARNAME>!! I have heard tell of those pools but I have never seen them. Elminster believes them to be a leak from one of the other Planes but can't say which one. Certainly, this flower is like nothing else anywhere in Faerun.~
@3631 = ~Now - please - give me one day longer. By then Eildaren will either be recovered or she will be dead. There is no other course with this disease.~
@3632 = ~I will return tomorrow, Garalial - and I hope your sister recovers.~
@3633 = ~One day, Garalial? Is that all it will take? Are you sure?~
@3634 = ~I am sure <CHARNAME>. One day will suffice.~
@3635 = ~Your apology is accepted, Anomen. I think I would also have been as suspicious, especially considering the history between Jaheira here and myself.~
@3636 = ~Your apology is accepted, Anomen. For someone who aspires to be a knight, perhaps you will think twice before accusing without fact in the future.~
@3637 = ~So you're back then, Bhaalspawn. I'd hoped that you'd give up and go away but Mystra isn't always that kind.~
@3638 = ~You owe me, Geltarath. I want that curse lifting or I'll take it out of you in blood. Hear me?~
@3639 = ~I've told you often enough that you cannot frighten me, Bhaalspawn. I have seen and dealt with worse than you in my time - some of your own brothers and sisters make you look like a pet xvart in comparison. You want the curse lifting in Porthpentyrch? Very well - I keep my promises for good or ill and much as I despise you and your rag-tag band, I will go to Porthpentyrch and lift that curse. Do not attempt to follow me for at least one week - one week, do you understand? If you come blundering into the village before that time is up you will destroy the counter-magic and condemn the village for all time. Now get out. The sight of your face is making me ill.~
@3640 = ~So you're back then, <CHARNAME>! Your trip to Imradim has saved my sister's life - I cannot thank you enough! Eildaren is fit and well again, as you can see!~
@3641 = ~I was not pleased at being forced into a trip to the Calim Desert, Garalial, but I can't deny that it was worth it.~
@3642 = ~It was... for me and for Eildaren, it really was.~
@3643 = ~And Porthpentyrch...?~
@3644 = ~I know... Sometimes it pained me, sometimes I found it funny. It is as Eildaren says, though you may like to seek more proof than just my sister's words.~
@3645 = ~I will agree that it makes dry chewing and has very little flavour to recommend it.... I am content for now.~
@3646 = ~We will leave immediately. Now I have Eildaren and Angharad with me, I can be sure that the curse will be lifted. Be there in one week and not before. If you enter the village before the curse is lifted, you stand a very good chance of destroying the counter-magic and that will condemn the village forever.~
@3647 = ~You fool! I warned you not to come here before the week is out, so what do you do? Welcome to the wreck of Porthpentyrch, Bhaalspawn - I hope you enjoy your legacy. I do not expect to see you again, in this world or the next!~
@3648 = ~Ah no! What are you doing here <CHARNAME>? Don't you realise that by coming here before the week is up you have destroyed any chance of restoring Porthpentyrch? I warned you this would happen!!~
@3649 = ~There is nothing more we can do here now - it is all over and finished with. Angharad, Eildaren and I will go back to Athkatla.~
@3650 = ~I hope you are satisfied now, Bhaalspawn. The village has been restored, the tanar'ri has returned to his own plane. I do not expect to see you again, in this world or the next!~
@3651 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I am pleased to say it was a success, as you can see. Better than that, Morvans here brews some of the best ale this side of Athkatla. Try it - you won't be disappointed.~
@3652 = ~Better even than Winthrop's 'Old Autumn' in Candlekeep?~
@3653 = ~How did you know I'd been there? Well, maybe not quite as good as 'Old Autumn' - but it's a close-run thing!~
@3654 = ~And what of the tanar'ri...?~
@3655 = ~Returned to his own plane, An interesting character that one; his time trapped on the Prime Plane has somewhat changed his outlook. I do wonder if he will integrate well back in his own society.~
@3656 = ~But, I think we must return to Athkatla and leave the rest of Morvan's 'Fisherman's Warmer' to the locals. Eildaren here is not fully healed, despite her protestations to the contrary. You are welcome at any time to our house.~
@3657 = ~But, I think we must return to Athkatla and leave the rest of Morvan's 'Fisherman's Warmer' to the locals. Eildaren here is not fully healed, despite her protestations to the contrary. You are very welcome at any time to our house - even Jaheira here will find a place next to the fire.~
@3658 = ~As do I.~
@3659 = ~That is between you and me, Garalial Geltarath but at least you acknowledge it. One day there *will* be an accounting but I will not involve <CHARNAME> in Harper business. You have my oath on this.~
@3660 = ~I am NOT you, Garalial Geltarath!!~
@3661 = ~It was not the *leaving* of the Harpers, Garalial Geltarath; it was the *manner* of leaving us. I am not surprised that she disowned you.~
@3662 = ~If you -~
@3663 = ~(Jaheira mumbles something to herself and looks away)~
@3664 = ~I will take this as a working premise for now, Garalial. It will not be the first time I have eaten humble pie - <CHARNAME> here is very good at feeding me that particular delicacy.~
@3665 = ~I will take you up on that offer, Garalial. It appears that you and I have a lot of catching up to do.~
@3666 = ~I look forward to that.~
@3667 = ~I do not like the sound of this, <CHARNAME>. This ex-Harper has given us no reason to trust him yet. What is he hiding, I wonder? Why does he want to send us to the wastes of the Calim Desert?~
@3668 = ~One moment, Garalial Geltarath, before we leave. I do believe that I owe you an apology for my harsh words spoken before we left for Imradim. I would give you that apology now and without reservation.~
@3669 = ~The Calim Desert. I like the sound of that; just think of all the sunshine we'll get. There's been too much rain around here lately.~
@3670 = ~What! No turnip soup?~
@3671 = ~Hmm. Perhaps I like the rain better than the sun after all.~
@3672 = ~So, maybe I will get to see this Pasha Baadilhaela and talk to him. To see if I can help my kinsman (and to remove him, most likely).~
@3673 = ~Jaheira... I beg of you one moment. I know that you do not see eye-to-eye with my brother and that he has never told you why he left the Harpers in the way he did. He did not tell you because I asked him not to - not to tell anyone at all. He left after what happened to Ceinwen because he helped her collect the things she needed for her necromancy through his Harper contacts.~
@3674 = ~After Ceinwen returned from Porthpentyrch close to death, she would not talk to him because he reminded her of what had happened and the pain was too raw to see beyond. Garalial felt that he had betrayed his place in the Harpers by almost killing his sister; he did not believe that he could be fully trusted again.~
@3675 = ~To protect Ceinwen I asked that he told no-one why he departed so suddenly and without explanation. Ceinwen dropped the name 'Geltareth' to loosen the memories; some years ago as a child she had been nicknamed 'Ravenhair' by Khelben Arunsun when she came to visit me during my clerical training. Yes, I am the elder by some six years. Now Ceinwen took this to be her only name.~
@3676 = ~That is why Garalial left the Harpers. I ask that you try to view his subsequent actions in this light.~
@3677 = ~You stun me with this information, Eildaren Colver. If this is true then I owe Garalial an apology that I do not know how to frame - I have blackened his name the length and breadth of the Sword Coast!~

@3719 = ~Why, this is Imradim, the most northerly oasis in the Calim Desert. Didn't you know that? Everyone around here knows it!~
@3720 = ~Go and talk to the fat man in the Water's Edge. I'm not telling you his name 'coz he doesn't like me.~
@3721 = ~Koury says the best weapons in the Calim Desert are made by the Wanderers of the Sand. You're lucky - they camped at the southern end of the town only today. They won't let me play with the shiny swords though.~
@3722 = ~That house belongs to the richest merchant in all of Imradim! One day I'm gonna be like him!~
@3723 = ~A rich merchant, eh? Who is that then?~

@3817 = ~Well, Gadil, my name is my own. I have questions for you that you will answer if you know what's good for you.~
@3818 = ~Well met <CHARNAME>. Is there anything you need repairing or making?~
@3819 = ~No, not that I know of. My weapons and armour all seem to be in good repair. I have some questions though, if you will answer them.~
@3820 = ~I will answer, if I can.~
@3821 = ~Imradim? It is better than some towns I have seen. At least we get the Wanderers of the Desert through here and a constant stream of caravans, which is good for work. This is the only oasis on this side of the Calim Desert, so most people have to come through here.~
@3822 = ~I repair and make most items that keep the women happy; pots and pans, that sort of thing. I fix waggons when the merchants are stupid enough to try and take them across the desert and when I have time, I make small geegaws - jewelry - for men to give to their wives. If you want arms or armour you will have to talk to Nuri and for potions of healing and protection, you will need to seek out Khoury of the Desert.~

Go south from here into the desert a short way and you will see some strange sand mounds with large holes in them.

@3926 = ~What's the pay like?~
@3927 = ~In truth, I can't wait to be out of this place and back somewhere that's a little cooler.~
@3928 = ~No, thank you.~
@3929 = ~We can discuss that at the end of the trip.~
@3930 = ~Sounds like a good excuse for a scam to me. I don't take jobs under those conditions.~
@3931 = ~Aye, well - there's always some as can't stand the heat. maybe you wouldn't be much good after all.~
@3932 = ~There's never a good wheelwright when you need one. Old Ali used to the best for leagues around but now he's retired and there's no-one in Imradim to replace him.~
@3933 = ~Strangers in town! At least, I've never seen your face in Imradim before!~
@3934 = ~I've never seen you before either. Where are you from?~
@3935 = ~I've never seen you before either. Now sod off and leave me in peace.~
@3936 = ~Sorry - I've no time to stop and talk.~
@3937 = ~Calimshan Port, as it happens. My second trip across the desert. I'm heading back that way soon and am looking for merchandise. You wouldn't have anything to sell, would you?~
@3938 = ~Nothing that would be of any use to you.~
@3939 = ~Huh! There's no need to be quite so offensive!~
@3940 = ~Ah well, it had to be worth asking.~
@3941 = ~Have you seen a horse-dealer around here? No, I didn't think so.~
@3942 = ~I'm an honest merchant trying to earn a decent living but I tell you those bastards down in Calimshan Port would rob you blind if you'd let them.~

//Imradim general population
@3950 = ~Imradim - jewel of the north Calim Desert. Where else would you ever want to live?~
@3951 = ~Have you heard? The rocks blocking the cave behind Gadil's house have suddenly vanished!~
@3952 = ~The cave behind Gadil's house is said to be the way to find the fabled Tiger's Eye, but it's been blocked solid with rocks for years. Many people have tried to dig their way in but always the roof keeps falling. Some have died trying.~
@3953 = ~I hate this place when the sandstorms blow.~
@3954 = ~The Water's Edge is the only waystation for fifty leagues around. It's a good job Tahir's reasonable with his prices.~
@3955 = ~When the wind from the south gets up it can be the worst place on earth to live. The temperature soars to the point where just walking from one end of town to the other will fry you. Then the sandstorms come and flay you alive before frying what's left of you. Yet at all other times there's nowhere else I'd rather live.~
@3956 = ~If it wasn't for the spring that fills the tank next to the Water's Edge, Imradim wouldn't exist.~
@3957 = ~If you're looking for my husband, he won't be back for days. He's away with a caravan heading east - I do miss him when he's gone. Can't wait to get rid of him when he's at home though.~
@3958 = ~Damn women. Always wanting more than you can give them.~
@3959 = ~I love the caravans that stop here. There's always something new to look at and buy.~
@3960 = ~I used to be a Caravan Master but gave it up years ago. Too many bandits wanting profit without working for it. Except that I guess they'd think of attacking caravans as work!~
@3961 = ~Anything that crosses the Calim Desert on the Trade Way comes through Imradim. The next town north is Memnon - full of the shark people, that place - and south of here is only league upon league of sand, all the way to Calimport itself. I like Memnon - you can sell anything to the sharkies. I did once consider selling my granny to them, but then I reckoned she'd give them such a hard time that they'd be glad to let her go. I'm not so sure that I'd be glad to get her back after that....~
@3962 = ~Don't believe everything old Tahir tells you. He spins a good yarn when he's a mind to.~
@3963 = ~The sand's been too quiet around here lately. I'm thinking it's time for sandstorm season to start.~
@3964 = ~I'm too busy to stop and talk right now - maybe later.~
@3965 = ~Old Tahir's done wonders with the Water's Edge. It used to be a complete fleapit.~
@3966 = ~If Tahir's serving roast camel then avoid it like the plague. I was farting like a donkey for a week afterwards and not even the donkeys would come anywhere near me.~
@3967 = ~Can't complain about the Water's Edge. It makes a serious sight for sore eyes after a week's worth of desert storms.~

//Wanderers of the Desert
@3970 = ~Yes? Talk to the head man if you want information.~
@3971 = ~I do not talk to strangers.~
@3972 = ~I pity you, stranger, that you do not know the beauty of the Calim Desert.~
@3973 = ~These - Imradims - would not know a good horse if it reared up and bit them.~
@3974 = ~By the law of our people I may not speak to you unless I am given permission by the head man.~
@3975 = ~You have never crossed the desert, have you, stranger? I can tell by your soft look - it stinks of the cesspits that these people call towns.~
@3976 = ~You may take the Wanderer from the desert, but you can never take the desert from within him.~
@3977 = ~You must speak to my husband before I may address you. I bid you go before you bring trouble upon me.~
@3978 = ~Go from me, stranger. I cannot be bothered with those that will not know the beauty of the days and nights in the desert.~

//Cave Guardian
@3990 = ~Halt! What do you want in here?~
@3991 = ~Who are you to ask?~
@3992 = ~There is something here that I have come far to gain.~
@3993 = ~None of your business, rag-bag.~
@3994 = ~I am the Guardian of this place, far from the sunlit surface as it is. I ask again, what do you want in here?~
@3995 = ~That 'something' would be the Tiger's Eye, would it, thief? What would you offer the Guardian in exchange?~
@3996 = ~I would ask you a question instead.~
@3997 = ~Your death?~
@3998 = ~I am already dead, so your offer has no currency for me. Try again, thief.~
@3999 = ~Then may I ask you a question instead?~
@4000 = ~Enough of the questions! It is time you were reduced to a pile of disconnected bones - permanently!~
@4001 = ~As you wish.~
@4002 = ~As you wish. But hear this well; this place allows of only one question, so ask it carefully.~
@4003 = ~What is your purpose in being here?~
@4004 = ~How long have you been here?~
@4005 = ~Why are you guarding the Tiger's Eye?~
@4006 = ~What is this place?~
@4007 = ~Who sent you here?~
@4008 = ~Can you give me the Tiger's Eye?~
@4009 = ~I have come for the Tiger's Eye to heal a friend. Will you let me take it?~
@4010 = ~What is so special about the Tiger's Eye?~
@4011 = ~Why does the Tiger's Eye grow here and nowhere else?~
@4012 = ~I ask you for your hand.~
@4013 = ~That is the wrong question, thief. You did not think hard enough.~
@4014 = ~That is the right question, thief-no-longer. One only who dwells in the sun knows to pass it on to those who seek for no gain. You may take the flower. Thief-no-longer, I would now ask of you a favour.~
@4015 = ~What is that?~
@4016 = ~I have no time for further quests - I must return the flower as quickly as possible.~
@4017 = ~I have dwelt here undead for countless years, seeing only those who come to thieve or to stare upon the beauty of the Tiger's Eye, wishing only for a true death. Will you give me that true death - the death of the warrior? Strike me down where I stand and let me join my brethren!~
@4018 = ~If that is truly your wish, I will grant it.~
@4019 = ~Someone must stay and guard the Tiger's Eye. You have done this well for so long and I think you should remain.~
@4020 = ~Then I will make it my business, thief.~
@4021 = ~I understand and wish you joy of your quest, thief-no-longer.~

//Elminster
@4050 = ~A ghoul! And with the boldness to walk in here, no less. Ah! but you're no ordinary ghoul are you, <CHARNAME>?~
@4051 = ~Yes, it is me and a sorry mess I am.~
@4052 = ~I'm surprised you recognise me at all.~
@4053 = ~Well don't just stand there! Do something about this!~
@4054 = ~I see that you have been talking to Ceinwen Ravenhair? Yes, I have too. That was a brave but foolish risk you took to cross the Traps of the Living, despite Ceinwen's	many warnings. And now here you stand, as undead as the village itself.~
@4055 = ~Ceinwen says that this change is permanent.~
@4056 = ~Can you do anything to reverse this?~
@4057 = ~Nothing is permanent in this world <CHARNAME>, not even me, not even Mystra. And I have been expecting you - wait one moment...~
@4058 = ~Wha-?~
@4059 = ~There you go, <CHARNAME>; free to roam the world unmolested again. Come and see me again when you have more news.~
@4060 = ~Hmmm. So not even this lesson penetrates that unpleasant skull of yours?~
@4061 = ~Look, just do something about this, will you?~
@4062 = ~Does the great Elminster have any sage words of advice to offer on how to remove this foul curse?~
@4063 = ~I will, but only because I believe I am partly reponsible for the situation. Wait one moment...~
@4064 = ~Done. Now, I would prefer that you leave here immediately and come back when you either have news about Porthpentyrch or you have learned better manners. Or preferably both.~
@4065 = ~How about 'learn to live with it'? You were warned that the effects would be permanent.~
@4066 = ~You're not serious! You've got to do something about it!~
@4067 = ~No.~
@4068 = ~No? You mean - as in 'you can but you won't'?~
@4069 = ~Yes.~
@4070 = ~But - !~
@4071 = ~You, <CHARNAME>, are one of the most unpleasant of the Bhaalspawn left alive. I would dearly love to leave you in this present form but I am partly responsible for it as I asked you to investigate Porthpentyrch in the first place. So - ~
@4072 = ~Done. Now, I would prefer that you leave here immediately and come back when you either have news about Porthpentyrch or you have learned better manners. Not that I have much hope about the latter.~
@4073 = ~Ah! My wanderer returns! Do you have any news for me?~
@4074 = ~Your village is dead, old man. The renegade Harper Geltareth made a mess of the counterspell.~
@4075 = ~That was not quite the story I heard.~
@4076 = ~You would believe the word of a lying ex-Harper and his cohorts?~
@4077 = ~I find myself less and less able to believe your word, <CHARNAME>. I also find myself wondering what Gorion saw in you.~
@4078 = ~That is your choice, old man. For myself, I would have as little to do with you in future as I possibly can.~
@4079 = ~Regretably, the feeling is mutual. I wish you peace, <CHARNAME>, but I can wish you neither luck nor fortune.~
@4080 = ~I have news but it is not good - and it is all my own fault. Garalial Geltareth warned me against visiting Porthpentyrch before his specified time was up but I did not heed him. Now the village is cursed with zombies and the tanar'ri is trapped forever within the lighthouse. If I could undo this stupid mistake, I would.~
@4081 = ~As you say, not good news, especially for those poor unfortunate villagers. What was Olren of Thay thinking of! Ach, there's no use in crying over spilt milk. Let this be a hard-won lesson to you in listening to people, <CHARNAME>! A whole village condemned by deaf stupidity!~
@4082 = ~Then there is no more need for me to wait here any longer. Come, Lief; it's a long road down to Calimshan. There's a certain greedy mage down there that I want a long word with.~
@4083 = ~Your village is saved, old man. I saved it for you. I also got rid of the damnable tanar'ri.~
@4084 = ~That is not quite the story I heard. Yes, Porthpentyrch is saved and the tanar'ri is returned to his own plane but I believe that you had help with this. I find myself less and less able to believe your word without getting independant confirmation, <CHARNAME>. I also find myself wondering what Gorion saw in you.~
@4085 = ~That is your choice, old man. I fixed your problem, so what are you whining about? For myself, I would have as little to do with you in future as I possibly can.~
@4086 = ~Porthpentyrch is saved and the tanar'ri is returned to his own plane. Garalial Geltarath did the trick!~
@4087 = ~Garalial Geltarath? The ex-Harper?~
@4088 = ~Well, he and Eildaren Colver and Angharad Firehair between them.~
@4089 = ~Ahh! I had long suspected that something wasn't quite as it seemed with Garalial and Eildaren. And Ceinwen. He was a staunch Harper and a good, reliable man until - until whatever actually happened to turn him away. It appears then that I must pay a visit to our mutual aquaintance.... but well done, <CHARNAME>! I wish you peace, luck and fortune. Come, Lief; it's a long road down to Calimshan. There's a certain greedy mage down there that I want a long word with first.~
@4090 = ~What! Ah, <CHARNAME>! What brings you here? And looking so dejected, to boot!~
@4091 = ~Err... you'll need to go to Porthpentyrch yourself, Elminster. I confess that I have made a mess of things.~
@4092 = ~Go and sort your own problems out in that stinking fish village, old man. I am through with it.~
@4093 = ~If you are so determined then I will go, but I had expected better of you! If that is your decision, then we have no further words to exchange.~
@4094 = ~Oh, sod off, old man. I've had enough of this.~
@4095 = ~Yes, I know. I met Ceinwen but a few minutes ago and she told me of the problem. Ah well, I can see that I need to have a few words with this tanar'ri myself. Go in peace, <CHARNAME>. If nothing else, you have learned that it is not always possible to do everything you set out to do. Life has a nasty habit of stabbing you in the back when you least expect it.~
@4096 = ~Yes, I know. I met with Garaliel Geltarath but a few minutes ago and he told me of the problem. Thanks to your inaction Eildaren Colver died soon after you left him. That was not an act I looked for from you!~
@4097 = ~I can see that I will need to have a few words with this tanar'ri myself. Go, <CHARNAME>. If nothing else, you have caused the death of a good cleric and an almost-certain member of the Harpers. I hope that you are proud of the work you have accomplished here.~
@4098 = ~What? <CHARNAME>! Have you come from Porthpentyrch? Have you discovered the problem?~
@4099 = ~I have and the news is not good - not good at all.~
@4100 = ~Yes. I suppose you want to know what's happened?~
@4101 = ~It would be helpful.~
@4102 = ~Then I suppose I must tell you. I thought you were the all-knowing Elminster.~
@4103 = ~I suspected you would say something like that. Please tell me the whole story.~
@4104 = ~(Tell the story of the tanar'ri and Ceinwen Ravenhair)~
@4105 = ~Spellhold. The Cowled Wizards are starting to reach beyond themselves with that place. So you have not passed the Traps of the Living and without Ceinwen there is no other way? *sigh*~
@4106 = ~So the tanar'ri says.~
@4107 = ~Ceinwen Ravenhair is in Spellhold, you say? Ah, such a fate is not for her - I will not have that. It seems that I must needs go to Brynnlaw myself and quickly. Expect me back here in, say, three days.~
@4108 = ~Very well.~
@4109 = ~Well met, <CHARNAME>. I see the rumours were right; you did make quite a mess of Spellhold.~
@4110 = ~But Irenicus escaped.~
@4111 = ~I did, didn't I? Where's the woman Ravenhair?~
@4112 = ~Yes, he did, more's the pity. What made the Cowled Wizards believe they could hold such a one? I wish you good hunting in your quest for him, but before you ask - I cannot help. If I had the time, I would also have had the time to deal with the problem in Porthpentyrch.~
@4113 = ~Where is Ceinwen Ravenhair?~
@4114 = ~At home, I believe, in the Government District Westside. Recently painted the house red, she tells me.~
@4115 = ~Thank you, Elminster.~
@4116 = ~Gah! Couldn't you have brought the woman here?~
@4117 = ~I would be careful with your manners, <CHARNAME>. Ceinwen is not known for her patience.~
@4118 = ~I can handle her - or anyone else who crosses my path.~
@4119 = ~Well, good luck to you.~
@4120 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, have you any news about Porthpentyrch?~
@4121 = ~No, not yet. I'm still looking.~
@4122 = ~All in my own good time, greybeard.~
@4123 = ~You'd better get to it then. I can't wait around forever and neither can Porthpentyrch!~
@4124 = ~I'll get there as soon as possible.~
@4125 = ~I'll think about it old man. Now shut up and leave me be.~
@4126 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>! This town crier is a little noisy, is he not? Repeats himself, too. Hmm. Have you reconsidered my request?~
@4127 = ~I am sorry Elminster, but I have not.~
@4128 = ~Yes, I have. What is it you want me to do?~
@4129 = ~Ho there wanderer! Stay thy course a while to indulge an old man. [yselm01]~
@4130 = ~Elminster!~
@4131 = ~Do I know you?~
@4132 = ~Elminster!!! What a pleasure it is to see you again!!~
@4133 = ~(Sigh) Am I to believe that you truly do not recognise me? It has been so long since someone really meant that. Has it been so long since I last saw you, <CHARNAME>?~
@4134 = ~(Laugh) It was worth the try just to see what you would do! I am delighted to meet you again, Elminster.~
@4135 = ~And I you. It was a sad business with your brother Sarevok, but I do confess myself pleased that it was you who survived and not him. That is a mess that I would not have liked to have cleaned up.... but now further things are a-stir and I like them not either (sigh).~
@4136 = ~The trouble with Sarevok is all behind me now and I don't care much to be reminded of it. As to what else is afoot on the Sword Coast, I too intend to find out.~
@4137 = ~But it's still part of you - the Bhaalspawn essence. So far you have dealt with it well but I am not sure that your severest test is not yet to come.~
@4138 = ~Perhaps. We shall see. At the moment I am much more interested in who this Jon Irenicus is and also where Imoen is.~
@4139 = ~I will worry about that when it happens - it is the immediate future I am most concerned with.~
@4140 = ~As it happens, I too. I have a large network of informants throughout Athkatla and Amn, all looking for trouble! - or signs of it. Most information eventually finds its way to me.~
@4141 = ~Then I too will keep my eyes open. I owe you that much!~
@4142 = ~Of that I have no doubt!~
@4143 = ~I will be in Trademeet for a short while yet. And now, <CHARNAME>, if you will excuse me, I really do have to be on my way.~
@4144 = ~I am sorry to be so abrupt but I have been hearing rumours of a problem down Watcher's Keep way - you wouldn't have heard anything on your travels, would you? I am too old to be wandering the length and breadth of Amn chasing will'o'the wisps here, there and everywhere.~
@4145 = ~(Laugh) I've never yet found you short of energy! Most days you could outpace me and I'm no slouch. Here though - I have a letter for you from a mage I met outside the Crooked Crane near Athkatla's City Gates. He was very insistant on getting a letter to you, come the Hells or high water, so it may have something to do with it.~
@4146 = ~(Reads swiftly and sighs heavily) Hmm, yes. Things ARE much worse than I had expected. Lief was right - the information in this letter is important.~
@4147 = ~But you will be able to sort it all out, right?~
@4148 = ~I'm sure that it won't give you too much of a problem.~
@4149 = ~Well...... I think this time I would be grateful for YOUR help. Would you have the time to follow up this information that Lief has gathered?~
@4150 = ~Of course! What is that you need?~
@4151 = ~Not at this time. I have too little time and too many things to follow myself. Perhaps in the future?~
@4152 = ~A little spying work really, nothing much, a minor thing. Lief says that a small seatown just south from here has started acting strangely. Well, the inhabitants, not the town itself! It seems they have all got up and left, for no discernable reason whatsoever. Deserted it! If you wouldn't mind the detour, I'd be grateful if you'd take a look and let me know what you find?~
@4153 = ~I think I could manage that. Where will I find you?~
@4154 = ~The last time you 'helped' me I got into all sorts of trouble and ended up fighting for my life against my brother. I think I'll give this a miss!!~
@4155 = ~Mmm. That's a good point. I was staying here in Trademeet but now I'm headed for Athkatla to catch up with Lief. Knowing him, he's probably in the Den of the Seven Vales! It's my guess that I'll be in Athkatla for some weeks.~
@4156 = ~'In Athkatla' - that's about as good as I'm going to get, isn't it? I'd try the Seven Vales if I were you; the last time I was there they'd gotten hold of a barrel of very good Winter Brew. That should keep both you and Lief in the Den for a while and give me a chance of finding you!~
@4157 = ~If I find you, fine. If not, I'm not chasing after you.~
@4158 = ~Oh, I am sure we shall meet again somewhere! Until then, Mystra keep her eyes on you. And now, <CHARNAME>, if you will excuse me, I really do have to be on my way.~
@4159 = ~Oh well, never mind. I am sure we shall meet again somewhere! Until then, Mystra keep her eyes on you. And now, <CHARNAME>, if you will excuse me, I really do have to be on my way.~
@4160 = ~Oh, well, never mind, it's probably nothing. I'm sure our paths will cross again at some point. Until then, farewell.~
@4161 = ~A little spying work really, nothing much, a minor thing. Lief says that a small seatown just north of Watcher's Keep has started acting strangely. Well, the inhabitants, not the town itself! It seems they have all got up and left, for no discernable reason whatsoever. Deserted it! If you wouldn't mind the detour, I'd be grateful if you'd take a look and let me know what you find?~
@4162 = ~I will be at the Den of the Seven Vales with Lief. I will wait for you there.~
@4163 = ~I confess that I may have been much mistaken about Garalial Geltarath and if so, I also have much to make up to him.~

@4214 = ~Never heard of him. Why do you want to talk to him?~
@4215 = ~I was told that he could help me.~

@4218 = ~Megred Darlesson.~
@4219 = ~Ailoth Tam.~
@4220 = ~I knew the wee bastard couldn't be trusted! Yes, I'm Maredudd Bengoch. Now state your business before I really lose my temper.~
@4221 = ~Ah, I'm glad I've found you at last. I have a message for you.~
@4222 = ~Let me see now... what is my business?? Cerendor Hold has lost its human rodent population. Megred Darlesson is dead. The caravan is destroyed. Your poor pathetic excuse of a bunch of guards are also all dead and your last shipment of Black Lotus is still smouldering as we speak. Rather a good cleanup operation, though I say it myself. Does that answer your question?~
@4223 = ~Is that so, big-mouth? I think you are about to get a second smile about two inches below the first!!!~
@4224 = ~Spill it. I'm running out of patience.~
@4225 = ~There will be no more Black Lotus coming up the Sword Coast via Cerendor Hold. Megred Darlesson is 'retired', as is Mordaran Rockfist. The latest caravan never made it out of the Cloudpeak Mountains but ended its days as a funeral pyre for some rather expensive goods.~
@4226 = ~WHATTT!!!! Who gave you such a message?? Tell me now before I slit your throat as well as theirs!!!~
@4227 = ~I did.~
@4228 = ~No, no - I didn't hear you properly. I thought I heard you say that you gave yourself the message?~
@4229 = ~That's correct. Your days of smuggling Black Lotus along the Sword Coast are well and truly over. The entire supply line is broken; Cerendor Hold is no longer in your hands and most of the participants are missing, dead, or about to be dead. Your choices here are two; you can go back to the Moonshae Islands or you may throw yourself on the mercy of the local magistrates.~
@4230 = ~As it happens, I was involved in all of those events and it has taken me a great deal of time and trouble to track you down. Your days of smuggling Black Lotus along the Sword Coast are well and truly over. The entire supply line is broken; Cerendor Hold is no longer in your hands and most of the main participants in your illicit operation are missing, dead, or about to be dead. Personally, I've had just about enough of the un-necessary bloodshed that this has caused so I'm going to give you two choices: you can go back to the Moonshae Islands or you can throw yourself on the mercy of the local magistrates.~
@4231 = ~You forgot the third way, you diseased turd of a dog!!!~
@4232 = ~You say it's *all* destroyed? All of it? Thay? Calimport? Homen Odesserion? Pasha Baadilhaela? They're dead too? I don't believe you've taken down the Thayan wizard. It's just not possible!~
@4233 = ~I have it on firsthand authority that Elminster is on his way to Calimport to have a long word with Pasha Baadilhaela. After that; I don't know. I guess we'll see just how long Odesserion remains a Tharch of Thay.~
@4234 = ~Homen Odesserion has had his nose severely tweaked. I would think that just about now thoughts of vengeance will be winging Calimport's way. He will be convinced that Pasha Baadilhaela has double-crossed him and I doubt anyone is going to risk their lives to disabuse him of that notion.~
@4235 = ~So. You stand there and brazenly tell me that you've destroyed my very profitable trade and you expect to walk away from here without a scratch. Do you know something? I can't believe I'm saying this but you're about to do exactly that. Information got through to me from Cerendor Hold a few days ago and one of my men found the remains of the caravan yesterday.~
@4236 = ~So you're the reason why everything has gone wrong. I wondered who in the Hells was powerful enough to wreck everything I'd spent so long building up but now I see you, I know you. You're that thrice-damned Bhaalspawn who's been making all the noise up and down the Sword Coast between here and Baldur's Gate.~
@4237 = ~Put down your arms, lads; I know when it's worth fighting and when it's not. That's why I've survived so long in the smuggling business. I'll give the Moonshae Islands a miss but I suspect that the local magistrates will be only marginally less dangerous. At least I'll get to keep my head here but there's no chance of that back home.~
@4238 = ~As for you, whatever you call yourself; in other times I could have found a place for you in my organisation. You're too dangerous to leave running around loose.~
@4239 = ~Just turn yourself in, Bengoch. I'll be asking after you in a day or so and if I get no word, you'll have me back on your tail again.~
@4240 = ~Ailoth Tam - yes, remember him? - tells me you're trying to smuggle Black Lotus the length and breadth of the Sword Coast. I'm not happy about that. I don't like the idea of ruining people's lives for profit.~

@4243 = ~That's the general idea. Your days of smuggling Black Lotus along the Sword Coast are well and truly over. The entire supply line is broken; Cerendor Hold is no longer in your hands and most of the participants are missing, dead, or about to be dead, including the caravan you still hope will arrive here. Your choices here are two; you can go back to the Moonshae Islands or you may throw yourself on the mercy of the local magistrates.~
@4244 = ~As it happens, yes; and it has taken me a great deal of time and trouble to track you down. Your days of smuggling Black Lotus along the Sword Coast are well and truly over. The entire supply line is broken; Cerendor Hold is no longer in your hands and most of the main participants in your illicit operation are missing, dead, or about to be dead, including the caravan you still hope will arrive here. Personally, I've had just about enough of the un-necessary bloodshed that this has caused so I'm going to give you two choices: you can go back to the Moonshae Islands or you can throw yourself on the mercy of the local magistrates.~

@4264 = ~Eh?~
@4265 = ~What-what? Are you some kind of small dirty animal?~
@4266 = ~I'm so sorry but you startled me and I don't think well when I'm startled.~
@4267 = ~Who are you?~
@4268 = ~You seem to have been leagues away from here.~
@4269 = ~I am Karim, son of Tahir.~
@4270 = ~Son of Tahir, eh? Well Karim, I am <CHARNAME>. Tell me, why did I startle you so? Did you not hear me approach? I was making enough noise!~
@4271 = ~Not leagues, no; within sight, in fact. Please, forgive my lack of manners - I am Karim, son of Tahir.~
@4272 = ~I will tell you if you promise not to laugh. Everyone laughs; except my father and he just pulls faces and shakes his head.~
@4273 = ~I promise I will not laugh.~
@4274 = ~I'm not sure I can promise that, Karim.~
@4275 = ~Well, you look like you're the honourable sort, so I'll tell you. I am wandering afar in my thoughts with Jehan, my love.~
@4276 = ~Jehan? Who is she?~
@4277 = ~Ohh right. I think I know where this is going. Goodbye, Karim - I hope you get what you want and soon.~
@4278 = ~And that is the problem. Jehan is the daughter of Mukhtar and Mukhtar is the right hand of Qadir, chief of the Wanderers of the Desert. One who is worth many horses and much gold, far more than my father Tahir has or could ever have. She loves me and I love her. Jehan... Jehan.... just the sound of her name is pure music to my ears. 'The beautiful flower' - that's what it means. Did you know that?~
@4279 = ~No Karim, I did not.~
@4280 = ~Yes, Karim, I did know that. ~
@4281 = ~Then you have learned something new, something beautiful. Like a flower... Jehan... *sigh*.~
@4282 = ~What do you intend to do about this?~
@4283 = ~Thank you for telling us about Jehan, Karim; she sounds absolutely wonderful. But now I must speak with your father - goodbye, Karim.~
@4284 = ~'The beautiful flower' *sigh*. ~
@4285 = ~Thank you for telling us about Jehan, Karim, but I really must be going now. I hope you get what you want and soon.~
@4286 = ~(Karim stares away into the distance and ignores you)~
@4287 = ~Erm... err... you wouldn't...?~
@4288 = ~I wouldn't what?~
@4289 = ~I think I know where this is going. Goodbye, Karim - I hope you get it sorted out soon.~
@4290 = ~You - wouldn't speak to Mukhtar for me, would you? I'll do anything for Jehan - anything!!!~
@4291 = ~'Anything', Karim? That's a big word.~
@4292 = ~What would I say to Mukhtar?~
@4293 = ~Anything!!!!~
@4294 = ~Then what would I say to Mukhtar?~
@4295 = ~Ask him what his bride-price is!!~
@4296 = ~Bride-price? Aren't you a little young to be considering marriage?~
@4297 = ~Very well. I will see what Mukhtar has to say about the matter.~
@4298 = ~I am older than my father when he paid the bride-price for my mother. I am old enough.~
@4299 = ~You do not appear to be old enough to me, Karim. No, I cannot do this; not without Tahir's permission.~
@4300 = ~My father will not give his permission! Go away and leave me alone!!~
@4301 = ~I am Karim, son of Tahir and you - whoever you are - can leave me well alone!~
@4302 = ~Yes? Have you spoken to Mukhtar? What is his bride-price?~
@4303 = ~I have spoken to Mukhtar and he says you are not welcome to court his daughter. In fact, it would be very unwise of you to go anywhere near the Wanderers' camp right now if you want to stay in one piece.~
@4304 = ~He couldn't mean it? Surely?~
@4305 = ~He meant it. He threatened to remove certain parts of your anatomy if you tried it.~
@4306 = ~Nooo - ! Jehan, my Jehan, my lovely Jehan. How can I live without you? *sob* Jehan! *sob*~
@4307 = ~I have spoken to Mukhtar; he has not set a bride-price. Instead, he has set a time during which you may not see or speak with Jehan. For one year you must stay apart and after that, if nothing has changed, he will name the bride-price.~
@4308 = ~You couldn't afford it, so forget it.~
@4309 = ~One year - ! I will die before then! Oh, what will be come of me without Jehan? My Jehan? *sob*~
@4310 = ~I have spoken to Mukhtar, yes, and he has spoken to Jehan - ~
@4311 = ~Yes? Yes? What did he say?~
@4312 = ~I'm sorry Karim, but Jehan said she cannot marry you.~
@4313 = ~Jehan said she can't stand the sight of you.~
@4314 = ~No! I don't believe you! She couldn't have - I love her! *sob*~
@4315 = ~That's the way of the world, Karim.~
@4316 = ~You - ! You - ! I hate you! You're lying to me! Leave me alone!~
@4317 = ~Oh, grow up and shut up. There are other fish in the sea - ah, camels in the desert - if you know where to look.~

@4334 = ~I am. What of it?~
@4335 = ~I have been speaking to Karim, son of Tahir. It appears that he fancies himself in love with your daughter, Jehan.~
@4336 = ~Nothing. I just wanted to know.~
@4337 = ~So I have heard. My daughter will marry no-one who is not of the Desert. My word is final; if he even attempts to see my daughter he will carry his testicles home in his mouth. Tell him so.~
@4338 = ~As you wish.~
@4339 = ~So I have heard. What is it he wants this time?~
@4340 = ~He wishes you to name a bride-price.~
@4341 = ~Oh, never mind. I've just decided to let him sort this mess out himself.~
@4342 = ~You show some wisdom for a Northerner. Tell him this: my daughter will marry no-one who is not of the Desert. My word is final; if he even attempts to see my daughter he will carry his testicles home in his mouth. Tell him so.~
@4343 = ~The bride-price, is it? He is growing bold indeed! What makes him think that he is good enough for my daughter?~
@4344 = ~Ah. I am not sure that he is even of an age to know what he asks or does. What does Jehan think of this?~
@4345 = ~He believes that he is.~
@4346 = ~She is as soft in the head about this Karim as he is about her. But I agree with you - they are too young. In principle I am not against the union. Tahir is a good man and his son has been brought up in the traditions of the desert. Tell him he must wait one year; that will cool them both, I think.~
@4347 = ~I will do that.~
@4348 = ~I am not minded to give my daughter to a town-dweller, least of all one so young, even if his father is rich by comparison to all others in Imradim. Yet; let us see what Jehan has to say on this. What would you want to do, daughter?~
@4349 = ~Well, what say you to that, Northerner?~
@4350 = ~It seems final enough to me. I will give Karim your answer.~

@4402 = ~I was sailing to Calimport when I was in a shipwreck off Myratmar; somehow I ended up in this flea-bitten camel's-armpit of a town. Pheugh - even the wine's lousy here. I'd advise you to give it a complete miss.~
@4403 = ~Calimport? What business did you have there? How will you get back?~

@4406 = ~What's a camel?~
@4407 = ~What did you want in Calimport?~
@4408 = ~Eh? Oh - you won't have seen one, will you? There's no caravan in at the moment. Imagine the ugliest beast you've ever seen - no, don't imagine it. You'd never believe me. Spits better than a Moonshae sailor and that's saying something. Farts like an Amkethran soldier and sways like the arse of a drunken whore. Only good thing about it is that it can go for days without water - good for the desert, you see.~
@4409 = ~That does take some believeing, I have to admit. Why were you headed for Calimport anyway?~
@4410 = ~Eh? Oh - you won't have seen one, will you? There's no caravan in at the moment. Imagine the ugliest beast you've ever seen - no, don't imagine it. You'd never believe me.

Only good thing about it is that it can go for days without water - good for the desert, you see.~
@4411 = ~Why was I going to Calimport? I can't remember now. It seemed important at the time. Maybe I should just give up and go back to Nemesser but that would defeat the point. No, I'll wait for the next caravan and see if my memory improves when I get to Calimport.~
@4412 = ~Not if you carry on drinking that rotgut it won't.~
@4413 = ~Take some imagining? Go and ask Tahir if you don't believe me. No, don't ask Tahir. He'll only laugh at you - he laughed at me when I asked. (gulp). Pheugh - this wine does not improve by the mouthful. The more I drink, the worse it tastes.~

@4569 = ~Aiesha has already said: she is no hag. Must you continually insult her?~
@4570 = ~What difference does it make whatever you are called? Where is the damned flower?~
@4571 = ~You are so impatient, Northerner. It does not hold well for you at all. Very well; Aiesha sees that to remove your unwanted shade from Imradim she must help you. You can find the Tiger's Eye in the cave above the house of Gadil.~
@4572 = ~Ah! At last! Good riddance, old hag.~
@4573 = ~Don't lie to me, old hag. I've been there and the cave is blocked.~
@4574 = ~Then you did not look properly. Aiesha tells you that the cave is open and Aiesha does not lie.~
@4575 = ~We will see. If you are wrong, your life will be forfeit.~
@4576 = ~Such dire threats, Northerner. Does your head not grow heavy with them? Leave Aiesha now; she has given you your answer and does not wish to speak with you again.~
@4577 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, you have helped Aiesha and now Aiesha will help you. The flower of the Tiger's Eye grows not in the light but in the dark. It grows only in the cave behind the house of Gadil. Climb to where you can see Imradim like a bird and you will find it.~
@4578 = ~Ah! Then I can get it and go. But I have heard that the cave is blocked?~
@4579 = ~I've been there and the entrance is blocked. How do I get in?~
@4580 = ~Aiesha says the cave is now open, <CHARNAME>. Aiesha is not wrong. But before you go, Aiesha would ask of you a favour.~
@4581 = ~What is it? I will help if I can.~
@4582 = ~I do not have the time - I must get the Tiger's Eye back to Geltarath.~
@4583 = ~Aiesha wishes new cloth to make clothes, but she is unable to walk. Pashan is a good son but he holds not a thought in his head for more than the wingbeat of a fly. Adara, the wife of Gadil, is a skilled weaver of bright cloth and Aiesha would like some of the good saffron made in a new robe. Aiesha has asked Adara to make this but no-one has collected it for Aiesha.~
@4584 = ~Ah - and you wish me to get the robe?~
@4585 = ~If <CHARNAME> has the time.~
@4586 = ~I will get Aiesha - I mean you - the new robe.~
@4587 = ~Always a lack of time in these days. Aiesha understands though and wishes you the gods speed.~
@4588 = ~Have you brought Aiesha's new robe?~
@4589 = ~Here it is.~
@4590 = ~You are good to Aiesha. Aiesha thanks you and hopes that your friend will heal his sister soon.~
@4591 = ~You are good to Aiesha. Aiesha has a piece of advice for <CHARNAME>; ask the Guardian for his hand.~
@4592 = ~Who is the Guardian?~
@4593 = ~Aiesha says you will find out. Do not forget to ask him. Aiesha also hopes that your friend will heal his sister soon.~

@4600 = ~I wouldn't go up there if I was you.~
@4601 = ~Why not?~
@4602 = ~Shut up, fool.~
@4603 = ~I just wouldn't.~
@4604 = ~Is it dangerous? What's up there?~
@4605 = ~You'll regret it, you will. Just don't go up there.~
@4606 = ~Well; what did you find?~
@4607 = ~Two Beholders but I've killed them for you. The strange thing is, they just disappeared when the first one died and they left behind the body of a gnome.~
@4608 = ~You - killed - them??? Left behind - the body of - a - a - gnome?~
@4609 = ~THAT'S MY BROTHER ADAG YOU'VE KILLED you great stupid ASSHOLE of a <PRO_RACE>!!! It was an ILLUSION!!!!~
@4610 = ~But - but !~
@4611 = ~GET -OUT- OF MY HOUSE!!!!~
@4612 = ~I told you not to go poking where you weren't wanted.~
@4613 = ~There's a Beholder up there!! Two damn Beholders!! Why didn't you tell me? How did they get in??!!~
@4614 = ~Well now; a Beholder you say? Last time I looked it was a lich. Are you sure it wasn't a lich-Beholder?~
@4615 = ~There's no such thing as a lich-Beholder, you stupid old fool!~
@4616 = ~Hmmm - I might be a fool but I'm not old. Not yet anyway. Maybe I'd  better take a look myself.~
@4617 = ~Nope - I don't see no Beholder. You haven't been drinking Keldrel's homebrew again, have you?~
@4618 = ~NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN DRINKING KELDREL'S HOMEBREW!!! THERE WERE TWO BEHOLDERS IN THIS ROOM!!!~
@4619 = ~There's no need to be rude and shout now, is there? I don't see no Beholder - do you?~
@4620 = ~There was one right here and one over there. I tell you, there were two Beholders in this room!!~
@4621 = ~Ah, you've probably had too much to drink of old Keldrel's ale and don't want to say. Powerful stuff, it is. Don't worry about it - you're not the first one and you won't be the last, I daresay.~
@4622 = ~But you told me not to come up here because it was dangerous!~
@4623 = ~Did I? I don't recall. I'll be away back to my work now, if you don't mind.~
@4624 = ~Oh - hello. You haven't left yet then?~
@4625 = ~Just who in the hells are you anyway?~
@4626 = ~Shut up, you stupid fool. I have had just about enough of this and I want to know what's going on.~
@4627 = ~I do have a name you know. Just for your information it's Bran and I am a carpenter and a cabinetmaker. Now, if you're seeing things that I can't see, I suggest you stay off the drink. Or something more exotic, if that's it. Please excuse me but I really do have work to do.~
@4628 = ~I'm Bran, the local carpenter. Pleased to make your aquaintance.~
@4629 = ~Okay Bran - I'd really like to know what's going on here.~
@4630 = ~I can't help you there, friend. If you're seeing things that I can't see, I suggest you stay off the drink. Or something more exotic, if that's it. Now, I really do have work to do, so if you'll excuse me.~

@4650 = ~Well, what can I get you? A drink? A room for the night?~
@4651 = ~Do you know anything about a gnome that lives in one of the houses in the North Wall?~
@4652 = ~What do you have?~
@4653 = ~Nothing at the moment.~
@4654 = ~Ah, you mean Bran. Let me guess - there was a lich in the house.~
@4655 = ~Two Beholders actually.~
@4656 = ~Yesss - actually that would have been Adag, his brother. A skilled illusionist, that one. Between the two of them they've been putting the wind up almost anyone who passes through here. No use going back for revenge - they've got just enough sense to run when they've wound up someone who can do some damage.~
@4657 = ~Uh - they did run away, yes?~
@4658 = ~No. Adag is dead. I killed him.~
@4659 = ~Well, it was going to happen one day so I can't say I'm that surprised. Someone was going to act first and ask later. I'm sorry that it happened though.~
@4660 = ~So am I.~
@4661 = ~Stupid git. He deserved to die for a trick like that.~
@4662 = ~What's done can't be undone. Now, what can I get you?~
@4663 = ~Do you know anything about a gnome called Bran? He says he's a carpenter.~
@4664 = ~Let me guess. You saw a lich in his house.~
@4665 = ~It was a damned Beholder as it happens. Two Beholders. Wait - what do you know about this??~
@4666 = ~Fair frightened you, didn't it? It's his brother, Adag. Adag is an accomplished Gnome Illusionist and between the pair of them, they've been frightening Nine Hells out of just about any passing stranger around here for the last few months.~
@4667 = ~I'm gonna kill the wee bastard!!~
@4668 = ~A gnome illusionist!! Ach - talk about being taken for a fool!~
@4669 = ~You can try, but you won't find anyone at home. They've got just enough sense to run like hell when they've wound up someone who can really hurt them. Give it a miss. Now, what can I get you?~
@4670 = ~No good going back for revenge either. They've got just enough sense to run like hell when they've wound up someone who can really hurt them. Give it a miss and chalk it up to experience. Now, what can I get you?~
@4671 = ~Have you spoken to that thieving little gnome yet?~
@4672 = ~I have; he talked about a drunken bet between your father and his in which your father won the Dragon's End.~
@4673 = ~Oh, so that's it, is it? I did wonder.~
@4674 = ~He said your da took advantage of his drunken state to wheedle him into doing something stupid and that he wouldn't give the place back to him when he had sobered up. He also said something about you being pulled out of a pile of dragonshit.~
@4675 = ~Well the dragonshit bit is true enough, although I'm not proud of it. As for the drunken bet; there's plenty round here will give you a different story. They were both well in their cups and the following day my da tried to give him the Rolling Gnome back but being stubborn and proud, Grunard Seltin wouldn't take it. They stayed friends for all that and as the inn prospered, Grunard said that losing it was the best thing he could have done for it. He wasn't too happy with it still being called the Rolling Gnome so me da' called it the Dragon's End after that crazy adventure we had up in the Stormhorn Mountains. Cured us both of adventuring, that one did.~
@4676 = ~I remember that Drosig Seltin always was a sulky child - I wasn't much older than him - but he disappeared from my life pretty quickly after that. I'm grateful for you confirming what I'd long suspected. He wouldn't speak to anyone round here and I guessed that only strangers could get the full story from him. So there's no point in wasting my money on yet another new nameboard and I really don't think the city guards would be that interested.~
@4677 = ~Probably not.~
@4678 = ~I have; he didn't want to talk to me and threw me out of his house.~
@4679 = ~So I'll never know why he keeps stealing my nameboard. Seeing that I'm the only inn in this part of Athkatla, I don't suppose I really need a nameboard anyway.~
@4680 = ~If you say so.~
@4681 = ~Ah, new faces, I see. New faces soon make old friends. What can I do for you?~
@4682 = ~Just tell me what you sell.~
@4683 = ~What is this place called?~
@4684 = ~Why, this is the Dragon's End Inn. Didn't you see the notice next to the door?~
@4685 = ~I saw no notice.~
@4686 = ~The what? What sort of a name is that?~
@4687 = ~You're as blind as the ale in the Copper Coronet is sour. There's no notice on the wall outside.~
@4688 = ~My, aren't you the grumpy one!~
@4689 = ~Yes, I am; now live with it.~
@4690 = ~A perfectly good name if you ask me.~
@4691 = ~Then I would guess from the name that you were at least partly responsible for the death of a dragon?.~
@4692 = ~Well.... not quite. It wasn't really a dragon, only a wyvern. Me da' was up the front end of the wyvern beating it's head in quite well and I was trying desperately to get a good blow in next to him. All of a sudden me da' sticks this wyvern right between the eyes with 'is sword.~
@4693 = ~And?~
@4694 = ~The wyvern swung its tail round and I ducked, but it chose that moment to let go a real rip-snorter of a fart.~
@4695 = ~But surely the wyvern was dead? You did say your father had stabbed it between the eyes?~
@4696 = ~You could say it was in the way of a parting gift. Have you ever smelt wyvern-fart?~
@4697 = ~I can't say I have....~
@4698 = ~Nor do you want to. Worse than all the world's rotten cabbages piled together and left to ferment under your nose. Worse even than the after effects of Jan Jansen's turnip soup.~
@4699 = ~That's pretty bad.~
@4700 = ~I didn't see you hiding there, Jan. How are you doing?~
@4701 = ~Maybe it wasn't quite that bad, but you get the picture anyhow.~
@4702 = ~So what happened next?~
@4703 = ~I don't know. The smell knocked me out - the next thing I remember is me da' shaking me and me waking up next to this bloody great lump of a dead wyvern. We sold 'dragon' steaks for months afterwards.~
@4704 = ~Did they taste good?~
@4705 = ~Dunno. Every time I clapped eyes on a steak I could smell rotten cabbage and worse. I just couldn't face eating one.~
@4706 = ~Oh, right. I *think* I understand why it's called the Dragon's End.~
@4707 = ~Well, you know more than me because I don't. You need to ask me da' for that - it was him that named it and I'm not sure I understood 'is sense o' humour at times. Now, are you sure you didn't see the nameboard up outside?~
@4708 = ~No; I saw no nameboard or notice at all.~
@4709 = ~*sigh* It's probably been stolen by that damn gnome again.~
@4710 = ~Why would a gnome want to steal your nameboard?~
@4711 = ~It's his way of 'getting revenge' on me, though I don't know what for because he won't talk to me. Say, you wouldn't go and have a word with him, would you?~
@4712 = ~I don't have much else to do at the moment. Where can I find him?~
@4713 = ~I'm a bit too busy at the moment.~
@4714 = ~Never mind - it was worth the asking. Are you interested in my wares?~
@4715 = ~It depends what you have.~
@4716 = ~A couple of houses north of here. Doesn't like visitors much, I will say that.~
@4717 = ~I'll go talk to him. Now, what do you have?~
@4718 = ~Here you go - I hope you enjoy it.~
@4719 = ~Ah well, maybe sometime soon.~
@4720 = ~I resent that. My turnip soup is the finest on the Sword Coast - just you ask <CHARNAME> here.~
@4721 = ~Just get on with the story, Keldrel. I'm still not sure whether I've been insulted or not.~

@4750 = ~Come in, <CHARNAME>, come in! I have been expecting a visit from you.~
@4751 = ~Eh? Who are you?~
@4752 = ~You nosy old git! Who are you and who told you I was here?~
@4753 = ~I am Jalil the astrologer and your visit was foretold in the stars.~
@4754 = ~Another crackpot. What's your business up here, old man?~
@4755 = ~I look for information on the future in the heavens and study the stars in their spheres. Don't you use the stars for navigation - for finding your way?~
@4756 = ~I know where I'm going and I don't need guidance from any stars to get there.~
@4757 = ~Oh dear. We all need help at some time in our lives. Even me. A word of advice, <CHARNAME>, if you'll hear it.~
@4758 = ~What stupidity are you going to spout now?~
@4759 = ~No I don't.~
@4760 = ~Tread lightly on your path. The consequences are terrible if you don't take care.~
@4761 = ~Ha! Is that all? How little you know!~
@4762 = ~Then there is little more than I can say to you.~
@4763 = ~Oh right. Er - was my visit really foretold in the stars?~
@4764 = ~Okay.... What else do you know?~
@4765 = ~The stars tell me that you are also a Bhaalspawn but beyond that, they cannot or will not say.~
@4766 = ~Cannot? Or will not?~
@4767 = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>. There is just a dark blank where you are concerned. Come - what brings you to Imradim anyway?~
@4768 = ~I thought the stars would have told you that!~
@4769 = ~You mean you don't know?~
@4770 = ~I am not perfect and reading the stars is not a precise science. I do my best but I know that my best isn't good enough.~
@4771 = ~I am in Imradim to look for the Tiger's Eye. Someone I know needs it to cure a very sick relative.~
@4772 = ~And they sent you? All the way from Amn?~
@4773 = ~He couldn't leave his sister, so I came instead.~
@4774 = ~If you haven't done so then you will need to speak to Aiesha. She is the only one who can help you.~
@4775 = ~Where would I find this Aiesha?~
@4776 = ~I have spoken to Aiesha.~
@4777 = ~In the house to the south of here. It's not very far.~
@4778 = ~Ah. I've seen the place - thank you. I will speak to her.~
@4779 = ~I wish you well in your quest, <CHARNAME>. May the stars always guide you wisely.~
@4780 = ~My wife Basimah helps Aiesha when she is needed. Basimah has some small skills of her own in the field of healing. Now, which temple was it she said? Ah - Lathander, that's who it was. Yes, Lathander. And she learned some magic too, although magic is frowned upon in Imradim. She once said that she had studied under Amelior Amanitas near Secomber, though she says that his habit of wandering off  in the middle of a lesson meant that she never really did learn much.~
@4781 = ~Your wife sounds as if she would be someone that you wouldn't want to cross.~
@4782 = ~No, not really, <CHARNAME>. She wouldn't say boo to a goose and she's very industrious. Always out helping someone when she's not helping Aiesha. Hmm.

@4802 = ~Unfortunately.~
@4803 = ~Fool. What did he think he could achieve?~
@4804 = ~With us both dead it would have removed a considerable source of embarrassment. Still, I thank you for your help, <CHARNAME>. I couldn't have gotten this far without you. How can I reward you?~
@4805 = ~With 2000 gold pieces?~
@4806 = ~With 10000 gold pieces?~

@4816 = ~I'm looking for someone called Akil and my guess is that's you.~
@4817 = ~Just looking around. I saw the cave and came in.~
@4818 = ~I'm asking the questions. In case you hadn't noticed you're outnumbered here. Now, who are you?~
@4819 = ~I don't chose to answer that question at this time. Tell me who you are first.~
@4820 = ~Okay. You don't look like the normal dirty dungeon crawler after lost treasure, so I'll tell you. I'm Akil.~
@4821 = ~And I am <CHARNAME>, originally from Athkatla. I've been looking for you.~
@4822 = ~Akil, eh? I'm <CHARNAME>, from Amn. No, I'm not some dirty dungeon crawler but I have a habit of poking around in caves.~
@4823 = ~In case you hadn't noticed you're outnumbered around here. Now, who are you? Quick about it!~
@4824 = ~<CHARNAME>. Just <CHARNAME>~
@4825 = ~Good, <CHARNAME> just <CHARNAME>. That wasn't so difficult was it? A name for a name - I'm Akil and these are my friends. Be careful around here, <CHARNAME>.~
@4826 = ~Akil? I've been looking for you.~
@4827 = ~Akil. And this is your cave is it?~
@4828 = ~This is my cave. My hideout. My 'home from home'.~
@4829 = ~Is it now? I detect some hidden story here. I'd be interested to hear it if you want to tell it.~
@4830 = ~If you're looking for me then you've been talking to that bastard Levon, haven't you? Has he given you a price for my head? There's a few who've tried to take it and failed. Are you going to be next?~
@4831 = ~Calm down Akil. Levon wants you dead alright but I'm not so sure. The price on your head is a little too high for a common bandit.~
@4832 = ~The price on your head? 2000GP and I'm about to take it!!~
@4833 = ~So you want my story? There's little enough to tell and I daresay you've heard it many times before. A tale of stupidity, cupidity and revenge. Are we sitting comfortably? Good - then I'll begin.~
@4834 = ~My first mistake was to fall in love with Levon's daughter, Aaliyah. Well no, it wasn't a mistake at the time; it just became one later. My second mistake was deciding to show Levon that I was good enough for his daughter.~
@4835 = ~This is taking too long. I've decided that removing your head is a lot quicker.~
@4836 = ~And?~
@4837 = ~My third mistake was becoming a gem merchant, like Levon. I was good at it, you see - very good. A few trips to Calimport to bargain with the ships from Tashalar, a few more trips to the Border Kingdoms and one memorable trip to Nelanther and I was on my way to being rich.~
@4838 = ~Talos! - I even got a couple of trips in to Athkatla, but it took too long to get there and back using the Trade Routes. The sea was quicker.~
@4839 = ~So the day came when I figured I was successful enough to please even that old miser.~
@4840 = ~You asked for Aaliyah's hand in marriage?~
@4841 = ~I did - and the treacherous bastard agreed. He knew I was about to leave for one more trip to Suldolphor and Theymarsh, so he asked me to collect some gems for him from Almraiven.~
@4842 = ~Of course, I agreed. What harm could there be in that? What he didn't tell me was that the 'small package of gems' was a consignment of very high quality blue diamonds from the Smoking Mountains and worth almost as much as my entire stock and savings.~
@4843 = ~Tough. But I think I think I've had enough of listening to your sob-story.~
@4844 = ~Let me guess. They were stolen.~
@4845 = ~How did you guess? We were just clearing the western boundary of Spider Swamp when we were ambushed.~
@4846 = ~It looked like a grassfire - nothing unusual in that at this time of year - so we turned south along the wetlands to avoid it. That slowed us right down. The next thing we knew was a well-armed band of raiders coming out of the thick smoke and into the middle of us.~
@4847 = ~Grassfire? Pah. It was a perfectly done illusion spell. The caravan guards were taken down first; many before they had chance to draw swords. Then the raiders came for us - me and my six guards. Okay? There were eight merchants in that caravan and we were near the back but they came straight for us.~
@4848 = ~It could have been coincidence?~
@4849 = ~It could have been. Except for one thing. I heard one of the raiders say 'There they are - the bunch that Levon told us about'.~
@4850 = ~Can you prove that?~
@4851 = ~Of course I can't. I'm supposed to be dead, but I survived. The raiders killed my guards and I took a wound to the side during the melee. My horse threw me into the water and they assumed I was dead with all of the blood colouring the swamp around me.~
@4852 = ~What happened to the rest of the caravan?~
@4853 = ~Apparently the raiders cut it up, robbed one or two merchants to cover their tracks and got the hell out of there, along with the blue diamonds and all of my profits for the trip.~
@4854 = ~I had some gold pieces left in the purse on my belt and the wound wasn't as bad as it first looked. Three months later I rode back into Imradim and Levon's jaw made a hole big enough to just about serve as his grave. He recovered quickly and showed me great sympathy, but two days later I was served with a Notice of Compensation.~
@4855 = ~A 'Notice of Compensation'? What's that?~
@4856 = ~A claim on the loss of the blue diamonds. Said I'd not looked after them properly and had allowed them to be stolen while trying to escape. Said I'd blabbed about what I was carrying while drunk, except that I don't drink. And do you know what? Given what I'd heard the raider say, I wasn't that surprised.~
@4857 = ~All in all, he stripped me of every copper I owned - what wasn't taken to cover the cost of the blue diamonds was taken as compensation for loss and hardship. So he got his profit on the blue diamonds anyway.~
@4858 = ~And what of Aaliyah in all this?~
@4859 = ~Ah - now we come to it, don't we? Married off. Married off to a prince, no less, the Sultan's third son. I had some friends left - as you can guess, most of my 'friends' disappeared with my fortune - and I asked a few discreet questions.~
@4860 = ~The answers were very revealing. The offer for Aaliyah's hand came from the prince one week before that trip and I can prove that. An alliance with the ruling house makes Levon very powerful indeed, far more powerful than he could ever have been without it. I counted for nothing in the face of that.~
@4861 = ~But why take all your money?~
@4862 = ~Having failed to kill me once, he didn't dare try again. A poor Akil is far less trouble than a rich Akil.~
@4863 = ~An interesting sob-story, young Akil. Thank you for the entertainment - I think I'll remove your head for an encore.~
@4864 = ~Ah. I see. Where is the proof of the prince's offer?~
@4865 = ~In the public records in Calimport. I've seen it. Here's a copy of it - see that it's notarised as true? One other thing before you make a final decision - the raider I spoke about? Quite by coincidence he's in the Water's Edge waiting for the next caravan south. Rimon by name. I'd recognise him anywhere and I was going to introduce his belly to my knife. If you can get him out of the Water's Edge I'd like a word with him. At least to start with. Shall we say after nightfall?~
@4866 = ~An interesting sob-story, young Akil. Thank you for the entertainment - but I simply don't believe you.~
@4867 = ~I believe you may be telling the truth. After nightfall then, by the water tank.~
@4868 = ~Er - you can throw paralysis spells, right?~
@4869 = ~I could have rustled one up if needed. You didn't really mean all that about the fire-ants, did you?~
@4870 = ~Not me - I'm no mage. You didn't really mean all that about the fire-ants, did you?~
@4871 = ~I've seen it done - it's not pleasant at all. But no, I couldn't do it. I'm not sure I could even kill him if it came to that. I'm a merchant, not a mercenary.~
@4872 = ~Well, I think it's about time we had a word with Levon. Meet me in the trading room in his estate as soon as you're ready.~

//Rimon
@4900 = ~What do you want?~
@4901 = ~From the description I'd say you were Rimon.~
@4902 = ~So what?~
@4903 = ~There's a friend of yours would like a word with you.~
@4904 = ~I see no 'friend'. Where is he?~
@4905 = ~Outside, by the water tank.~
@4906 = ~Why doesn't he come in here? Has he got no legs to walk with?~
@4907 = ~He says he had a run-in with Tahir a few days ago and can't come in. Something to do with too much drink.~
@4908 = ~Huh. That could be anyone I know. Still, it won't hurt to check.~
@4909 = ~YOU!!! But you're supposed to be dead!! You died in that marsh - I know; I saw you face down in the water!!~
@4910 = ~Look, it was nothing personal. We were paid to do a job, right?~
@4911 = ~So that's how you think of it? Taking lives is just a job?~
@4912 = ~Sounds like easy paid work to me.~
@4913 = ~No - I didn't mean it like that, honest.~
@4914 = ~So how did you mean it? You've admitted that Levon paid you to kill Akil here. What's to stop me helping Akil to do the same to you?~
@4915 = ~Eh? W-what?~
@4916 = ~Forget it. Despite what I just said, there are some things I won't do. But what's to stop me helping Akil to do the same to you? You've admitted that Levon paid you to do the job.~
@4917 = ~All he wanted was the merchandise this Akil was carrying. He said it was stolen and he was paying a handsome reward for the recovery of it.~
@4918 = ~Did he now? So, Akil, there's the proof you wanted, right from the devil's mouth. What do we do with him now?~
@4919 = ~Don't kill me, please!!!~
@4920 = ~I'm going, I'm going!!!!~
@4921 = ~But I'm not, am I? I escaped that stinking marsh and made my way back here, to be ruined by that fat bastard of a power-grabbing merchant. And now you're going to help me get my revenge.~
@4922 = ~I think I am going to introduce his belly to my knife - slowly. Very slowly. And I'm going to blunt the knife first.~
@4923 = ~I don't believe I just heard you say that, <CHARNAME>. Tell me you didn't.~
@4924 = ~You ask for that after sticking a sword in me? I'll tell you what I'm going to do to you: I'm going to pin you out in the desert next to a nest of fire-ants and I'm going to flay you slowly so that every drop of blood attracts an ant.~
@4925 = ~I'm going to make sure that you get enough water to stop you from dying of thirst and I'll keep the fire-ants out of your ears and eyes and nostrils because I want to watch them strip you until the bones show. And you're going to see me watching you, enjoying the agony of each bite.~
@4926 = ~But I'll tell you what - I'll give you a fair start. You have ten minutes to get out of Imradim and that includes paying Tahir. I'd start running if I were you, because after that time <CHARNAME> here is going to lock you in a paralysis spell.~

//Levon
@4950 = ~Good day again! Well? Did you find Akil?~
@4951 = ~Yes - he's dead and so are most of his bandits.~
@4952 = ~Of course I did! Do you think I'm stupid?~
@4953 = ~Not yet.~
@4954 = ~Just so, just so. So you'll want your reward then? There you go and thank you for your help. Imradim thanks you for your help.~
@4955 = ~Akil! How pleased I am to see you! And your friend here.~
@4956 = ~Pleased,is it?~
@4957 = ~Come now Akil - business is business. Did you really think I could take the loss of the blue diamonds and do nothing?~
@4958 = ~Look; we've been though this before. I did not send bandits after you - how could I have known where you were?~
@4959 = ~One of your employees was rather more vocal than the rest. He also made the mistake of turning up here in Imradim. Akil and I have just had a quiet word with him and what he says was rather interesting. His name is Rimon - does that ring a bell?~
@4960 = ~Never heard of him.~
@4961 = ~Liar. He told us that you ordered the attack on Akil to steal the blue diamonds. Currently Rimon is in a hurry to leave Imradim before Akil feeds him to the fire-ants, but it wouldn't take much to find him. You have two choices, Levon: be shamed in public by Rimon or return to Akil what you stole from him. Aaliyah unfortunately cannot be included on that list.~
@4962 = ~And if I chose neither? What then? There is nothing you can do either way. And I admit nothing.~
@4963 = ~Not even the 2000GP you promised me for Akil's head? That was too high a price. Had you offered, say 200GP, then I may have tackled Akil and his bandits without a second thought. But as it is, think of the shame it would bring on your family.~
@4964 = ~Well, there's always the fire-ants....~
@4965 = ~You would not do it!~
@4966 = ~Think hard Levon, before making a decision. We have Rimon, we have your contract to me and we have Akil's word, all against just your word. The Prince would not be pleased to hear that his father-in-law is suspected of being a party to attempted murder.~
@4967 = ~I would do it and I'd enjoy doing it too. I don't like slimy toads like you.~
@4968 = ~This is blackmail! You're threatening to kill me!~
@4969 = ~You did more than just threaten Akil. So what's your choice? Shame or restitution?~
@4970 = ~Neither!! Guards!! Arrest these intruders!~
@4971 = ~You can't prove anything!~
@4972 = ~So be it. Akil, I'll come with you to seek audience with the Prince and set before him the proofs we have. We'd better catch up with Rimon before he gets too far - I hope your fire-ants didn't scare him too much!~
@4973 = ~NO!! You'll bankrupt me!~
@4974 = ~So much the better - it might make an honest merchant of you again. Pay back every copper you took from Akil and add your standard rate of interest on top.~
@4975 = ~Bandits? In my house?~
@4976 = ~Yes, don't forget the bandits Levon. They will take up residence here until the sum is paid.~
@4977 = ~May you rot in the outer abyss!~
@4978 = ~Oh, I probably will, Levon, I probably will. But if I don't hear from Akil that he has been repaid then I will make that visit to the Prince. A written confession from Rimon will help - and will probably save his life into the bargain. Farewell Levon - and don't have an unfortunate lapse of memory.~
@4979 = ~A good day to you! Have you come to the house of Levon to trade?~
@4980 = ~Trade? What do you sell here?~
@4981 = ~What is this place?~
@4982 = ~No.~
@4983 = ~I am Levon, a gem merchant and this is my trading house. I buy and sell gems of all descriptions from all over Calimshan and the surrounding countries. Come: take a look at these fine rubies. They arrived in today from Almraiven and tomorrow they will be on their way to Calimport.~
@4984 = ~Don't you get problems with bandits attacking the caravans?~
@4985 = ~Get that rat away from my gems now!~
@4986 = ~If you say so....eugh!~
@4987 = ~Ah, lady, put the ruby down. Each one is accounted for and only you are touching them.~
@4988 = ~I was not suggesting that, lady. Forgive me for offending you so!~
@4989 = ~They're hardly baubles young lady. That ruby alone has a value of some 3200GP.~
@4990 = ~It is true there are very few that can afford such a gem, young lady, but look at the clarity of it!~
@4991 = ~Nalia, shut up. This is not Athkatla and you are a d'Arnise whether you like it or not.~
@4992 = ~d'Arnise, eh? One of the noble familes of Amn, if I recall. You are a long way south of home, here in Imradim~
@4993 = ~As are we all.~
@4994 = ~That's none of your business.~
@4995 = ~True, true.~
@4996 = ~It occasionally happens but most caravans are well guarded. However, there is one bandit who has been particularly successful recently and seems to be preying on my caravans alone. I have managed to discover this bandit's name and also where he may he hiding out. I may have a little buisness for you if you're interested?~
@4997 = ~I may be at that.~
@4998 = ~No thank you. Not my line of work at all.~
@4999 = ~Hmm. A pity that. Well, I bid you a good day friend. I am a busy man and I have these rubies to send on their way.~
@5000 = ~Come upstairs and talk to me in private. These trading rooms are a little too public for such business.~
@5001 = ~This is more comfortable, is it not? As I was saying -er- ?~
@5002 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@5003 = ~It would be better to keep this on a no-names basis.~
@5004 = ~Just so. These bandits that I spoke of are holed up in a cave not far south of my estate. Their leader is a man named Akil - once a good son of Imradim but he has gone bad over the years. It's not just me he is raiding but anyone who passes through this way.~
@5005 = ~Just recently he attacked one caravan too many and killed two of my guards. The good people of Imradim have gathered together a reward of 2000GP for the apprehending of this criminal. We are not worried whether he is captured dead or alive, just as long as these attacks stop.~
@5006 = ~2000GP, you say? Hmm.~
@5007 = ~That is a large sum for the head of one bandit.~
@5008 = ~He has become too successful. We would have offered more but that is all we could gather.~
@5009 = ~I'll take the job. The cave is south of here, you say? I'll return when it's done.~
@5010 = ~No, I think I'll give it a miss. If he's as successful as you say, my life is worth more than 2000GP. Good day, Levon.~
@5011 = ~As you say. Now, if you will excuse me please, I have business to attend to.~
@5012 = ~And you, Levon, are a liar. You're happy to see me ruined, even if you'd rather see me dead.~
@5013 = ~So why did you send bandits after me?~
@5014 = ~I can't thank you enough for your help, <CHARNAME>. It won't bring back Aaliyah but it will go a long way to getting started again. It will even put some of those bandits of mine into honest employment!~
@5015 = ~Oo - Boo says: pretty sparkly things. Boo wants to hold them in his pouches!~
@5016 = ~Boo is not a rat! Boo is a minature Giant Space Hamster. See how his whiskers twitch - you have offended him now!~
@5017 = ~They're really pretty, <CHARNAME>. Even I am not immune to their charms!~
@5018 = ~I am a Harper, merchant! I do not steal!~
@5019 = ~So you're Levon the gem merchant. I've seen your baubles for sale in Athkatla.~
@5020 = ~3200 - ! Think of all the people that price could feed for a year!~

@5050 = ~What are you doing here? No wait - let me guess. Aiesha has sent you for some sour water.~
@5051 = ~Who's Aiesha?~
@5052 = ~Yes, she has. What is this 'sour water'?~
@5053 = ~What do you know about the Tiger's Eye?~
@5054 = ~Mind your own business, hag.~
@5055 = ~You will need to ask Aiesha about that.~
@5056 = ~What is this 'sour water'?~
@5057 = ~Just answer the question, hag.~
@5058 = ~'Hag', is it? If my sons spoke like that they would feel the wrath of my hand. But then maybe that's acceptable language in the barbarian lands. Begone, No Manners. Your company is not wanted here.~
@5059 = ~Oh - you've not met her yet. Aiesha is the town's wisewoman and healer. She knows everything that goes on in and around Imradim.~
@5060 = ~Where can I find this Aiesha?~
@5061 = ~'Wise' woman, eh? I've never met a wise woman yet. Plenty of stupid ones though.~
@5062 = ~In the big house in the middle of town.~
@5063 = ~Just in front of this house the water that gives Imradim its life comes almost to the surface. You can see it down the hole where the water has lifted the sand. It's not drinkable though; something poisons the water here and leaves it with a nasty taste. That is your sour water.~
@5064 = ~Oh, right. Thank you.~
@5065 = ~Oh, right. Thank you. I'd better take some of this sour water back to Aiesha then.~
@5066 = ~You have poor wits, barbarian, to insult half the town in one sentence.~
@5067 = ~I thought it was pretty good, myself.~
@5069 = ~If my sons spoke like that they would feel the wrath of my hand. But then maybe that's acceptable language in the barbarian lands. Begone, No-Manners. Your company is not wanted here.~
@5070 = ~A good day to you, northerner.~

@6056 = ~Read the third page~
@6057 = ~Read the fourth page~
@6058 = ~Read the fifth page~
@6059 = ~Read the last page~
@6060 = ~When did all this trouble start? I'm sure it was when that hells-damned Red Wizard arrived and decided to stay. What does he want here anyway? Porthpentyrch is a quiet village and we really don't want his sort here. He knows nothing abour fishing or farming and I'm sure he's up to something. The worst of it is he seems nice enough but I can't say I have any faith in him.~
@6061 = ~Continue~
@6062 = ~I heard a rustle round the back of the house last night. I thought it was a deer but when I went to look a large man-shaped figue disappeared into the dark. It was too misshapen to be a man but not big enough to be a troll. What would a troll be doing down here anyway? I also thought I saw that bloody wizard skulking in the bushes near the warehouse.~
@6063 = ~I'm sure I saw the ghost of Artan Catch-More this evening. With Porthpentyrch being a fishing town it's not unusual to see the ghosts of the drowned dead but Catch-More died in his own bed about ten years ago. It's not normal for the quiet dead to rise and walk, is it? What is going on?~
@6064 = ~I saw that man-shaped creature again too. I wonder if it had anything to do with the disappearance of Gadion Fast-Water? Widow Fast-Water woke the whole town this morning with her wailing; when we went to see what the problem was we found that Gadion's bed was a mass of blood and he was gone. Canna No-Fish was sick in the street at the sight of it.~
@6065 = ~Ghouls! What are ghouls doing here? And I'm sure I saw a ghast! Three more people have gone missing in the last two days - Donaut No-Fish and the two brothers Selevan and Conomor Full-Net. Mother Full-Net has gone out of her mind with grief.~
@6066 = ~Now we have these undead appearing when the sun goes down. By Mystra's own eyes I swear that one had the face of Gadion Fast-Water! There has to be a link between the disappearances and the undead but what is it!!??~
@6067 = ~It has to be that thrice-damned wizard. It *has* to be that thrice-damned wizard. I've seen him sneaking around after dark but the undead completely ignore him. Worse - the lighthouse has gone dark. For the last week Daalin the Light has not lit the fire at sundown - I'm not even certain that he's still alive. I don't want to think about how many ships are going to get wrecked on Grelthot's Fangs at the mouth of the Isthlwyn River. I last saw him running for the tool store just above the cave on the river almost three days ago.~
@6068 = ~A demon! There's a hells-bound and hells-damned demon in the lighthouse!! That's the last straw - we're leaving today as soon as the sun comes up. Half the village has already gone and we're not going to be the last to leave. I'll kill that bloody wizard if I can ever get my hands on him.~

@6085 = ~I am Salran of Athkatla, ma'am.~
@6086 = ~No, that doesn't sound right either - it has the smell and sound of yet another lie. I have nothing further to say to you.~
@6087 = ~You're the new arrival in the Hold, aren't you? I'm sorry - I didn't catch your name.~
@6088 = ~You don't need to know that. The fewer people that know who I am, the safer I am.~
@6089 = ~Oh. Then - what do I call you?~
@6090 = ~I'll know who you're talking to. Just talk away.~
@6091 = ~'Cerendor's New Guest'?~
@6092 = ~In truth, I'm <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, ma'am. And it's also true what I said - the fewer people that know who I am, the safer I am.~
@6093 = ~That's ridiculous. Go away and come back when you have a better answer.~
@6094 = ~Hm. I'm not used to talking to nameless folk. Not at all. No, I'm not going to break the habit of a lifetime - go away and come back when you have a better answer.~
@6095 = ~Candlekeep! It's been a long time since I've been there. Are you some sort of refugee? On the run from the law, perhaps? Escaping from the monks?~
@6096 = ~A refugee, eh? You could put it that way. I'm definitely not on the run from the law; in fact it would be truthful to say that I'm on the side of the law.~
@6097 = ~Escaping from the monks? Oh ma'am - if you could know just how much I'd give to be back there right now. Unfortunately Candlekeep is as closed to me as it is to any other traveller.~
@6098 = ~Candlekeep! Why didn't you say so?~
@6099 = ~That is a too-long story ma'am and I'm sure you don't have the time to listen.~
@6100 = ~Candlekeep! It's been a long time since I've been there. Still the same old fusty library full of monks, is it? Do the Voices still chant Alaundo's Prophecy every day?~
@6101 = ~Nothing changes in Candlekeep ma'am. The world could end and Candlekeep would still be standing.~
@6102 = ~It's still the same boring old hole that you remember, ma'am. Nothing changes.~
@6103 = ~Well, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep; as you are not well-known to our somewhat unwelcome Red guests, there is a small favour you could do me. The cook claims someone is stealing food from her kitchen each night. Not a great deal by all accounts but I'd like you to look into it, if you have the time.~
@6104 = ~Certainly ma'am. I'll do that for you.~
@6105 = ~I don't really have the time for that. Perhaps some other time.~

@6111 = ~Have you spoken to the cook yet <CHARNAME>?~
@6112 = ~No ma'am, I haven't.~
@6113 = ~Yes ma'am, I have.~
@6114 = ~And you've found the thief?~
@6115 = ~Not yet. I'm still looking.~
@6116 = ~No ma'am, I haven't. But I think I know who the thief is.~
@6117 = ~Yes ma'am, I have; and I think I know who the thief is.~
@6118 = ~Well?~
@6119 = ~I didn't have time to question him properly before he escaped, but I'm pretty sure that your thief was a gnome.~
@6120 = ~A gnome!! How was that possible?~
@6121 = ~He was hiding in the north tower, ma'am. I started to question him but he made a sudden dash for the door.~
@6122 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>, let us hope that the thief is gone and peace returns to the kitchen. Thank you for your help.~
@6123 = ~Ma'am.~
@6124 = ~No ma'am, I haven't. But I do know who the thief is.~
@6125 = ~Yes ma'am, I have; and I know who the thief is.~
@6126 = ~A gnome, ma'am. Name of Cado.~
@6127 = ~He was hiding in the north tower. I had a very interesting conversation with him about your unwelcome guests and just how he survived. You're aware of the rumours that surround the north tower?~
@6128 = ~About the ghost, you mean? All nonsense of course. We just don't use the north tower because we have no use for it.~
@6129 = ~Young Cado made very good use of that rumour to keep the bandits out.~
@6130 = ~He did what?! Oh, I don't believe it! I would love to have spoken to this gnome and had the story from him!!~
@6131 = ~The last I saw of him he was on his way to make peace with the cook. A very civilised gnome is Cado.~

@6227 = ~Of course I'm sure! I'm not blind you know!! Whatever it was disappeared through the door to the battlements and pretty sharpish too.~
@6228 = ~Right. That might help anyway. I'll leave you to your cooking.~
@6229 = ~About time too. Dinner won't cook itself you know and that one over there couldn't boil an egg to save its life.~
@6230 = ~If you really want to know it's bloody fish from that damned river for dinner tonight. Again. Again. I HATE cooking FISH!!!!~
@6231 = ~You there.  This is MY kitchen, and I don't like interlopers; so get out!~
@6232 = ~You there - yes you, you know-better-than-everyone-else hoity-toity pointy-ears!! This is MY kitchen, and I don't like elves, so get out!~
@6233 = ~But I haven't done anything!~
@6234 = ~But I'm not an elf!~
@6235 = ~OUT!!!!~
@6236 = ~You've got pointy ears haven't ye? Now get OUT!!!!~
@6237 = ~Didn't I tell you to get out?  I don't want you in my kitchen; can't you get that through yer thick skull?~
@6238 = ~It's you again. By the claws of Umberlee, I can't take these interruptions much longer. Get out of my kitchen and stay out!~
@6239 = ~Out! Out out out out OUT!!!~
@6240 = ~My wares are available to you at anytime. Please take a look~
@6241 = ~Well open up then.~
@6242 = ~Not now.~
@6243 = ~Thank you~
@6244 = ~Not at the moment, thank you~
@6245 = ~What do you want?~
@6246 = ~Who are you?~
@6247 = ~Don't be so rude, old man. You might just regret it.~
@6248 = ~That would not be a good idea, despite what you might think. Care to try it? Put your money where your mouth is?~
@6249 = ~One day, old man, one day. Who are you?~
@6250 = ~I am Havren HoldSmith, armourer and smith of Cerendor Hold.~
@6251 = ~What do you know about the Red Wizard guards around here?~
@6252 = ~You need to talk to the Caravan Master about that. I do smithing, not politicking.~
@6253 = ~Aye - and maybe you're right about doing that too. Do you have anything for sale?~
@6254 = ~Here you are~
@6255 = ~What can you tell me about the Thayan guards around here, Havren HoldSmith?~
@6256 = ~Dirt - nothing but dirt. Came in with the last caravan and just sort of took over, without actually saying so. The Caravan Master can tell you more than I.~
@6257 = ~Helped themselves to the weapons too, no doubt?~
@6258 = ~Why? What are you here for?~
@6259 = ~In Mystra's Name I intend to break the trade in Black Lotus but I'm needing help. ~
@6260 = ~Mystra?~
@6261 = ~Well - with a bit of help from Elminster too. I'm investigating a number of problems for him and so far they've all led here.~
@6262 = ~Elminster? I know Elminster.~
@6263 = ~It seems that everybody does. Ah well - I guess that comes with age.~
@6264 = ~To answer your question about the weapons: they tried to take them. I might look thick but I know which way the wind blows. No - I hid all the best stuff~
@6265 = ~Ah! Could we have a look?~
@6266 = ~Here you go.~
@6267 = ~Thank you for saving my life. That was a good thing that you did, going all that way to Imradim.~
